  [-]-version                         show gv version and exit

'FILE'
     The name of the file to be displayed.  The file ending '.ps' may be
     omitted.  FILE may point to a compressed file (gzipped, bzipped,
     zipped or compressed).  Viewing PDF files requires at least
     ghostscript version 4.x.
'--ad=FILE'
     Read and use additional resources from the file FILE.  These
     resources have higher priority than those provided in the context
     of the '--style' option.
'--antialias, --noantialias'
     Whether to use antialiasing.
'--arguments=ARGS'
     Start ghostscrip with additional options as specified by the string
     ARGS.
'--center, --nocenter'
     Whether the page should be centered automatically.
'--dsc, --nodsc'
     Determines if _document structuring convention_ (DSC) comments
     should be respected or ignored.  If '--nodsc' is used gv will not
     attempt to examine the structure of the document but will pass the
     file to the ghostscript interpreter as a whole.  In this case no
     page numbers are shown and freely moving around in the document is
     not possible.  This option may help when viewing files not
     conforming to the _document structuring conventions_.
'--eof, --noeof'
     Defines the behaviour of the postscript scanner used to examine the
     structure of the document.  If '--noeof' is used the scanner will
     ignore end of file (EOF) comments.  This may help when viewing
     documents which import other documents without enclosing them
     within the proper "BeginDocument" and "EndDocument" comments.  If
     '--eof' is used, the scanner treats an EOF comment as marking the
     end of the file.
'--fullscreen'
     Selects the fullscreen mode.
'--infoSilent'
     Do not show any ghostscript messages in an info popup window.
'--infoErrors'
     Only show error messages from ghostscript in an info popup window.
'--infoAll'
     Shows all ghostscript messages in an info popup window.
'--pixmap, --nopixmap'
     If '--pixmap' is used gv tries to maintain off-screen regions of
     the displayed page by allocating a sufficiently large pixmap.  If
     '--nopixmap' is used the _X Server_ is responsible for maintaining
     obscured portions of the displayed page (see also the
     _useBackingPixmap_ resource).
'--version'
     Print the version number of gv to standard output and exit.
'--help, --usage'
     Display a short help message and exit.
'--scale=N'
     N must be an integer or a positive float.  In case N is an integer,
     N selects the scale entry N relative to the scale 1.0.  With the
     special value of '-1000' Fit to page is selected, and likewise with
     the value of '-1001' Fit widthto page is selected.  In case N is a
     float, N selects an arbitrary scale.
'--scalebase N'
     Selects the scale base N.
'--monochrome, --grayscale, --color'
     Sets the color palette to be used.
'--media=MEDIA'
     Selects the paper size to be used.  Valid values are names of paper
     sizes that appear in the list of page medias as given by the MEDIAS
     resource.
'--page=LABEL'
     Display the page with label LABEL first.
'--orientation=ORIENTATION'
     Sets the orientation.  Valid values for ORIENTATION are 'portrait',
     'landscape', 'seascape' and 'upsidedown'.
'--quiet, --noquiet'
     Whether to start ghostscript with the '-dQUIET' option.
'--resize, --noresize'
     Whether ghostscrip is allowed to automatically fit the size of its
     window to the size of the displayed page.
'--password=PASSWORD'
     When opening a file, use PASSWORD to decrypt it.  This Option is
     usefull for viewing encrypted PDF files.
'--presentation'
     Is actually a shortcut for '--fullscreen --noresize --scale=-1000
     --widgetless'.
'--safer, --nosafer'
     Whether to start ghostscript in safer mode (that includes he
     '-dSAFER' option or the '-dDELAYSAFER' mode where appropriate) and
     the '-P-' option.
'--safedir, --nosafedir'
     Whether to start ghostscript from a safe direcotry or not.
'--spartan'
     This is a shortcut for '--style=gv_spartan.dat'.
'--style=FILE'
     Read and use additional resources from the file FILE.  These
     resources have lower priority than those provided in the context of
     the '--ad' option.
'--swap, --noswap'
     Whether to interchange the meaning of the orientations landscape
     and seascape.
'--watch, --nowatch'
     The '--watch' option causes gv to check the document periodically.
     If changes are detected gv will automatically display the newer
     version of the file.  The document is by default checked once every
     second.  This can be changed via the _watchFileFrequency_ resource.
     Note that sending gv the *SIGHUP* signal also causes an update of
     the displayed document.  This method may be used by document
     creators to trigger gv remotely.
'--widgetless'
     This is a shortcut for '--style=gv_widgetless.dat'.

3 Resources
***********

3.1 Resource files
==================

In general gv does not depend on any external resource files.  However,
when starting gv, preferences are read from

*a system specific resource file.*
     The name of this file is GV and is installed on as part of gv's
     architecture independent library.  Usually the library files are
     installed on '/usr/local/lib/gv'.

     Administrators may want to modify this file in order to set up gv
     according to the local needs of their system.
*a user specific resource file.*
     The name of this file is either '~/.gv' or as described by the
     'XUSERFILESEARCHPATH' environment variable.

   The files 'gv_user.ad' and 'gv_system.ad' (located in the library
directory of gv, which is most probably either '/usr/local/lib/gv/' or
'/usr/lib/gv/') may serve as a basis for constructing the user and
system specific resource files.

   Note that the user and system specific resource files are not the
only sources of preferences taken into account when gv is started.
However, in practice these are the most important.

3.2 Resources of gv
===================

The following describes some of the resources of gv.  The precise syntax
of some of the resource values may be inferred from the appended default
system specific resource file.

*antialias*
     Whether antialiasing should be used.  Valid values are 'True' and
     'False'.

     It defaults to 'True'.
*autoCenter*
     Whether the displayed page should automatically be centered (for
     instance when opening a new file).  Valid values are 'True' and
     'False'.

     It defaults to 'True'.
*autoResize*
     Whether gv is allowed to resize the main window according to the
     size of the current page.  Valid values are 'True' and 'False'.

     It defaults to 'True'.
*confirmPrint*
     Whether printing requires an extra confirmation.  Valid values are
     'True' and 'False'.

     It defaults to 'True'.
*confirmQuit*
     Whether leaving gv requires extra confirmation.  Valid values are
     '0' (Never), '1' (When processing) and '2' (Always).  The default
     value is '1', which causes a confirmation request when trying to
     leave gv in the presence of pending PDF to Postscript conversions.
*scrollingEyeGuide*
     If this resource is 'True' scrolling via the keyboard causes a
     temporary border to be drawn around the previously visible area of
     the page.  Allowed values are 'True' and 'False'.

     It defaults to 'True'.
*infoVerbose*
     Defines the behavior of the info popup which shows messages from
     ghostscript.  Valid values are 'Silent' (Never), 'Errors' (show
     only errror messages) and 'All' (Any message is being shown).

     It defaults to 'Errors'.
*xinerama*
     Defines whether the display resolution is determined by xinerama.
     Valid values are 'On' (use Xinerama if available), 'Off' (do not
     use Xinerama) and 'Auto' (heuristically decide whether to use
     Xinerama or not).

     It defaults to 'Auto'.
*ignoreEOF*
     Defines the behaviour of the postscript scanner as described in the
     Options section.  Valid values are 'True' and 'False'.

     It defaults to 'True'.
*respectDSC*
     Determines whether gv should attempt to respect document
     structuring comments.  Valid values are 'True' and 'False'.

     It defaults to 'True'.
*reverseScrolling*
     Defines the interpretation of directions when scrolling with the
     mouse.  Valid values are 'True' and 'False'.

     It defaults to 'False'.
*swapLandscape*
     Whether the meaning of 'landscape' and 'seacape' should be
     interchanged.  Valid values are 'True' and 'False'.

     It defaults to 'False'.
*scratchDir*
     Specifies a directory used to store temporary data.

     It defaults to the invocation directory.
*defaultSaveDir*
     Specifies the default destination directory for files to be saved.

     It defaults to the home directory, '~/'.
*useBackingPixmap*
     If the value of this resource is 'False' the _X Server_ is advised
     that saving off-screen pixels of the displayed page would be
     beneficial (maintaining backing store).  In this case gv does not
     actively maintain the contents of the page but relies on the _X
     Server_.  The server is, however, always free to stop maintaining
     backing backing store.  If the value of this resource is 'True' the
     _X Server_ is advised that maintaining backing store is not useful.
     In this case gv attempts to allocate a sufficiently large pixmap to
     store the contents of the displayed page.

     It defaults to 'True'.
*watchFile*
     Whether the document should be checked periodically and updated
     automatically if changes are detected.  Valid values are 'True' and
     'False'.

     It defaults to 'False'.
*watchFileFrequency*
     Defines the time in milliseconds elapsing between successive checks
     of the document when _watchFile_ is set to 'True'.  Allowed values
     must be larger than 500.

     It defaults to '1000'.
*printCommand*
     The command used for printing a file.  The command may contain
     multiple '%s' wildcards which will be replaced by the name of the
     file to be printed.

     It defaults to 'lpr'.
*saveposFilename*
     This file is used for saving positions by the 'z' and 'u' keys.

     It defaults to '~/gv.savepos'.
*gsInterpreter*
     The command used to start the ghostscript interpreter.

     It defaults to 'gv'.
*gsCmdScanPDF*
     The command used to extract document structuring comments from a
     PDF file.

     It defaults to 'gs -dNODISPLAY -dQUIET -sPDFname=%s -sDSCname=%s
     pdf2dsc.ps -c quit'
*gsCmdConvPDF*
     The command used to convert a PDF file to PostScript.

     It defaults to 'gs -dNODISPLAY -dQUIET -dNOPAUSE -sPSFile=%s %s -c
     quit'
*gsX11Device*
     The ghostscript command line option which activates the _X11_
     device.

     It defaults to '-sDEVICE=x11'
*gsX11AlphaDevice*
     The ghostscript command line option which activates the _X11_
     device with antialiasing enabled.

     It defaults to '-dNOPLATFONTS -sDEVICE=x11alpha'
*gsSafeeDir*
     Determines whether ghostscript should be started from a safe
     directory.

     It defaults to 'True'.
*gsSafer*
     Determines whether ghostscript should be started with the '-dSAFER'
     command line option.

     It defaults to 'True'.
*gsQuiet*
     Determines whether ghostscript should be started with the '-dQUIET'
     command line option.

     It defaults to 'True'.
*gsArguments*
     May be used to provide additional command line options for the
     ghostscript interpreter.  Starting gv with the '-arguments
     ARGUMENTS' option will override this resource setting.

     It defaults to the empty string.
*magMenu*
     Describes the menu that pops up when preparing to to zoom an area
     of the displayed page.

*dirs*
     Defines a list of directories accessible via the 'Directories' menu
     in the file selection window.  The special value 'Home' corresponds
     to the users home directory, the value 'Tmp' corresponds to the
     scratch directory as defined by the *scratchDir* resource.

     It defaults to 'Home Tmp /usr/doc /usr/local/doc'
*filter*
     Defines the default filter to be used when displaying a directory
     contents in the file selection window.  A filter is specified
     according to the syntax

        <filter>    := [<filespecs>] [no <filespecs>]
        <filespecs> := <filespec> [<filespecs>]
        <filespec>  := filename possibly including wildcards '*'
                       which match any character.

     Example: The filter

        GV*filter: *.ps *.pdf no .*

     screens out all files with names starting with a dot and keeps of
     the remaining ones only those which end on '.ps' or '.pdf'.

     It defaults to 'no .*'

*filters*
     Defines a list of filters offered in the _Filters_ menu of the file
     selection window.  The filter 'None' has a special meaning causing
     all files to be displayed when the corresponding menu entry is
     selected.

*miscMenuEntries*
     Describes the menu that pops up when clicking with the third mouse
     button on the displayed page.  The value of this resource is a list
     of menu entries.

     Allowed entries are

        * 'update'
        * 'reload'
        * 'toggle_current'
        * 'toggle_even'
        * 'toggle_odd'
        * 'unmark'
        * 'stop'
        * 'print_all'
        * 'print_marked'
        * 'save_all'
        * 'save_marked'
        * 'line'

*titleStyle*
     Whether the name of the displayed document should be shown in the
     title bar of the window.  The name of gv's icon will also change
     accordingly if this resource is set to 'True'.

     If this is '0', no title will be shown.  '1' means to show a the
     document title or the file name if there is no document title.
     Only the file name is shown with '2'.

     It defaults to '1'.
*maximumWidth, maximumHeight*
     When resizing gv will not attempt to exceed the size specified by
     these resources.  These resources may be specified as a positive
     integer or as 'screen', optionally combined with a positive or
     negative offset.  The default values listed above provide examples
     for this syntax.  'screen' will automatically be replaced by the
     size of the screen.

     'maximumWidth' defaults to 'screen-20'.  'maximumHeight' defaults
     to 'screen-44'.

*minimumWidth, minimumHeight*
     Defines a minimum size for the main window.  Valid values for both
     resources are positive integers larger than 200.

     'minimumWidth' defaults to '400'.  'minimumHeight' defaults to
     '430'.

*scale*
     Sets the initial scale.  The value of this resource is the offset
     of the scale to be selected relative to the scale 1.0 in the the
     _Scale_ menu.

     It defaults to '0'.
*scaleBase*
     Selects the initial scale base.  The value of this resource should
     be a positive integer.

     It defaults to '1'.
*scales*
     Defines the available scales bases and scales in the _Scale_ menu.

*orientation*
     Sets the initial orientation.  Valid values are
        * 'portrait'
        * 'landscape'
        * 'seascape'
        * 'upside-down'
        * 'automatic'

     'automatic' causes gv to attempt to derive the correct orientation
     from document structuring comments.

     It defaults to 'automatic'.
*fallbackOrientation*
     Defines the paper-size to be used when automatic orientation
     detetction fails.  Valid values are 'portrait', 'landscape',
     'seascape' and 'upside-down'.

     It defaults to 'portrait'.
*medias*
     A list describing the page medias known to gv.  List entries
     starting with '!' or '#' will not appear in the _Media_ menu but
     will still be used for automatic paper size detection.

*pageMedia*
     Sets the paper size.  Allowd values are as given in the above list
     of paper-sizes.  Specifying 'automatic' causes gv to attempt to
     derive the correct paper-size from document structuring comments.

     It defaults to 'automatic'.
*fallbackPageMedia*
     Defines the paper-size to be used when automatic paper-size
     detetction fails.  Valid values are as given in the above list of
     paper-sizes.

     It defaults to 'a4'.

*strings.**
     Variuos strings for translating GNU gv.

4 Mouse and key bindings
************************

4.1 Mouse bindings in the Main and the Zoom window
==================================================

The following mouse events are defined when the mouse pointer is either
on the displayed page or on a zoomed area:

*press button 1, move mouse, release button 1*
     Scrolls the displayed page 'proportionally'.
*press button 3, move mouse, release button 3*
     Scrolls the displayed page 'absolutely'.
*double-click with button 1*
     In the main window this displays the previous/next page if the
     double-click occured in the left/right half of the window.  In a
     zoom window it does nothing.
*press button 2, release button 2*
     Pops up a small menu which allows to choose a magnification for a
     certain area around the current mouse position.  After selecting a
     magnification a zoom window pops up displaying the area at the
     chosen scale.
*press button 2, move mouse, release button 2*
     This draws and thereby defines a rectangular region which can be
     displayed in a zoom window.  The magnification for the area can be
     selected by means of a popup menu which appears after releasing
     button 2.
*press button 1, press button 2*
     Reload the current page.  This event sequence works only in the
     main window.
*press button 3, release button 3*
     Pops up a small menu which offers a few standard actions like
     'Reload', 'Mark Page', etc.

4.2 Mouse bindings in the File Selection popup
==============================================

The following mouse events are defined when the mouse pointer is in the
window of either a file or a directory list:

*press button 1, move mouse, release button 1*
     Scrolls a file or directory list 'proportionally'.
*press button 2, move mouse, release button 2*
     Scrolls a file or directory list 'absolutely'.
*press button 2, release button 2*
     Scrolls a file or directory list one page up/down if the button was
     pressed in the upper/lower half of the list.
*double-click with button 1 on a filename*
     Selects the file and closes the File Selection popup.
*click with button 1 on a directory name*
     Causes the contents of this directory to be displayed.

4.3 Mouse bindings in the Table of Contents
===========================================

The following mouse events are defined when the mouse pointer is in the
window showing a list of page numbers of the current file (table of
contents):

*press button 1, move mouse, release button 1*
     Scrolls the table of contents.
*press button 1 on a page number*
     Go to this page.
*press button 2 on a page number*
     Mark this page if it is unmarked, but unmark it if it is marked.
*press button 2, move mouse, release button 2*
     Marks/unmarks all unmarked/marked pages in the region crossed by
     the mouse pointer during the movement.

4.4 Mouse bindings in the Panner widget
=======================================

The Panner widget is the rectangular region located close to the left
edge of the main window.  It indicates the size and the position of the
visible area of the current page relative to the total page.

   The following mouse events are defined when the mouse pointer is in
this region:

*press button 1, move mouse*
     Scrolls the displayed page.
*press button 2*
     Display the previous page.
*press button 3*
     Display the next page.

4.5 Mouse bindings in the << and >> button windows
==================================================

The << and >> buttons are used to move to another page.  The following
mouse events are defined:

*press button 1*
     Move 1 page forward/backwards.
*press button 2*
     Move 5 pages forward/backwards.
*press button 3*
     Move 10 pages forward/backwards.

4.6 Key Bindings

5 Comments about the user interface
***********************************

5.1 Scales
==========

The _Scale_ menu which allows to view the document at different sizes is
divided into two parts.  The first part shows a list of available scale
bases, the second part, separated by a line, lists the relative scales
which are applied with respect to the selected scale base.

   By default two scales bases are available, the _Natural size_ and the
_Pixel based_ base.  When choosing the _Pixel based_ scale base a
relative scale of 1.0 causes one postscript point to correspond to one
pixel on the screen.

   When viewing a document at a relative scale of 1.0 using the _Natural
size_ base the page should appear in its real size, as if printed on
paper.  For the _Natural size_ base to work properly gv has to know the
correct size of the root window.  Automatic detection of this size
unfortunately only provides approximate results, therefore it is best if
it is provided by the user.  To do so the resource

   GV.screenSize:  <width> x <height>

   should be added to the 'SCREEN_RESOURCES' property of the screen the
document is viewed on, with WIDTH and HEIGHT describing the width and
height of the root window in units of millimeters.  For instance by
using the command

   echo "GV.screenSize: 396 x 291" | xrdb -override -screen

   a width of 346 mm and a height of 291 mm will be used for the
_Natural size_ scale base.  Alternatively the resource

   GV.screenSize_<machine>_<disp>_<scr>:  <width> x <height>

   may be added to a resource file read by gv.  Here MACHINE ,DISP and
ANGLED describe the display on which gv displays the document.  For
instance, if the display is set to 'tic.tac.toe.wo:0.1' the resource
should be specified as

   GV.screenSize_tic_0_1: 396 x 291

   Note that this method doesn't work on VMS. As a last alternative the
resource

   GV.screenSize:  <width> x <height>

   may be added to one of the resource files.  However, for obvious
reasons this method should be used only on single user machines.

5.2 Scrolling
=============

It is probably a _de facto_ standard for user interfaces that windows
are supposed to be scrolled by means of scrollbars attached to their
sides.  However, for various reasons the use of scrollbars has been
minimized in gv.

   Instead, in all windows with obscured data, scrolling may be
performed by

     pressing button1, moving the mouse, then releasing button1

   directly in the window.  This includes the displayed page, zoom
popups, the table of contents and the file and directory lists displayed
in the file selection popup.

5.3 Displaying new versions of a document
=========================================

During document creation it is usually desirable to always display the
newest version of the document in work.

   Instead of explicitly loading it via the file selection popup the
most recent version can be displayed by pressing the *Reload* button in
the main window.  Choosing the *Reload* entry in the menu that pops up
when clicking with the third mouse button anywhere on the displayed page
certainly has the same effect.

   More comfortable is the "Watch File" feature which may be switched on
by selecting the corresponding entry in the *State* menu.  If activated
gv will check every now and then if a new version of the displayed file
exists.  If so it will be displayed automatically.  By default the file
is checked about once every second.

   Finally it may also be left to the document creating program to
trigger gv to update its display.  To do so the program should send the
SIGHUP signal to gv.  For instance at the end of a shell script
generating a postscript file from latex sources the line

   kill -SIGHUP <gv_pid>

   may be added (here GV_PID is the process id of gv).  Executing the
script and thereby creating a new version of the document will then also
cause the result to be displayed instantaneously.  Please note that this
feature is available only on X11 R6 based systems.

6 Frequently asked questions
****************************

6.1 What happened to the scroll bars?
=====================================

They have been removed in order to make more room for the image.  The
displayed portion of the image may be moved by dragging the image or the
paner (panel between the "Save Marked" and << >> buttons) with the
mouse.  Alternatively, the cursor arrow keys can be used.

6.2 How can I make even more room for the image?
================================================

Use the "spartan" style by starting gv with the command

         gv --spartan

   This removes the "Open", "Print", "Save", "Reload", and page marking
buttons (they are still available from the "File" and "Page" menus) and
replaces them with the document attribute controls, which are normally
along the top.

6.3 Small characters are not very clear
=======================================

Antialiasing can improve the display of bitmapped fonts (eg.  from TeX)
when displayed on a colour or greyscale screen.  The same technique is
used by xdvi.  Note that antialiasing requires at least Ghostscript
version 4.x.

   Antialiasing can be turned on from the "State" menu, and can be made
default by saving the setting in 'State | gv Options...'.

6.4 The output is not refreshed automatically
=============================================

There are two methods that can be used to save the contents of the
window when it's not currently displayed: backing store and backing
pixmap.  Some X-servers seem to support only backing store (eg.
VAXstations) and some only backing pixmap (eg.  some X-terminals,
including EWS).

   In order to force gv to use one method or the other, use the 'State |
Setup Options ...' menu and toggle the "Backing Pixmap" button.  When
selected/highlighted (normally the default), gv will use backing pixmap;
otherwise it will use backing store.  Select "Apply" to use a new
setting and "Save" to make it the new default.

7.1 Interface with ghostscript
==============================

7.1.1 Ghostview interface to ghostscript
----------------------------------------

When the 'GHOSTVIEW' environment variable is set, ghostscript draws on
an existing drawable rather than creating its own window.  Ghostscript
can be directed to draw on either a window or a pixmap.

7.1.2 Drawing on a Window
-------------------------

The 'GHOSTVIEW' environment variable contains the window id of the
target window.  The window id is an integer.  Ghostscript will use the
attributes of the window to obtain the width, height, colormap, screen,
and visual of the window.  The remainder of the information is gotten
from the GHOSTVIEW property on that window.

7.1.3 Drawing on a Pixmap
-------------------------

The GHOSTVIEW environment variable contains a window id and a pixmap id.
They are integers separated by white space.  Ghostscript will use the
attributes of the window to obtain the colormap, screen, and visual to
use.  The width and height will be obtained from the pixmap.  The
remainder of the information, is gotten from the GHOSTVIEW property on
the window.  In this case, the property is deleted when read.

7.1.4 The GHOSTVIEW environment variable
----------------------------------------

*parameters*
     'window-id [pixmap-id]'
*scanf format*
     '"%d %d"'

   Explanation of parameters:

'window-id'
     tells ghostscript where to
        * read the GHOSTVIEW property
        * send events
     If pixmap-id is not present, ghostscript will draw on this window.
'pixmap-id'
     If present, tells ghostscript that a pixmap will be used as the
     final destination for drawing.  The window will not be touched for
     drawing purposes.

7.1.5 The GHOSTVIEW property
----------------------------

*type*
     STRING
*parameters*

     'bpixmap orient llx lly urx ury xdpi ydpi [left bottom top right]'

*scanf format*
     '"%d %d %d %d %d %d %f %f %d %d %d %d"'

   Explanation of parameters:

'pixmap'
     pixmap id of the backing pixmap for the window.  If no pixmap is to
     be used, this parameter should be zero.  This parameter must be
     zero when drawing on a pixmap.
'orient'
     orientation of the page.  The number represents clockwise rotation
     of the paper in degrees.  Permitted values are 0, 90, 180, 270.
'llx, lly, urx, ury'
     Bounding box of the drawable.  The bounding box is specified in
     PostScript points in default user coordinates.
'xdpi, ydpi'
     Resolution of window.  (This can be derived from the other
     parameters, but not without roundoff error.  These values are
     included to avoid this error.)
'left, bottom, top, right (optional)'
     Margins around the window.  The margins extend the imageable area
     beyond the boundaries of the window.  This is primarily used for
     popup zoom windows.  I have encountered several instances of
     PostScript programs that position themselves with respect to the
     imageable area.  The margins are specified in PostScript points.
     If omitted, the margins are assumed to be 0.

7.1.6 Events from ghostscript
-----------------------------

If the final destination is a pixmap, the client will get a property
notify event when ghostscript reads the GHOSTVIEW property causing it to
be deleted.

   Ghostscript sends events to the window where it read the GHOSTVIEW
property.  These events are of type ClientMessage.  The message_type is
set to either PAGE or DONE. The first long data value gives the window
to be used to send replies to ghostscript.  The second long data value
gives the primary drawable.  If rendering to a pixmap, it is the primary
drawable.  If rendering to a window, the backing pixmap is the primary
drawable.  If no backing pixmap is employed, then the window is the
primary drawable.  This field is necessary to distinguish multiple
ghostscripts rendering to separate pixmaps where the GHOSTVIEW property
was placed on the same window.

   The PAGE message indicates that a "page" has completed.  Ghostscript
will wait until it receives a ClientMessage whose message_type is NEXT
before continuing.

   The DONE message indicates that ghostscript has finished processing.

Appendix A GNU General Public License
*************************************

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified
     version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
     version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To "grant"
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
===========================

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
