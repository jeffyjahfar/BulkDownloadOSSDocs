Measure complexity of C source
******************************

This file documents Complexity version 0.4.  It is a tool designed for
analyzing the complexity of "C" program functions.  It is very similar
to the McCabe scoring, but addresses several issues not considered in
that scoring scheme.

   This edition documents version 0.4, updated May 2011

1 Introduction
**************

Complexity measurement tools provide several pieces of information.
They help to:

  1. locate suspicious areas in unfamiliar code

  2. get an idea of how much effort may be required to understand that
     code

  3. get an idea of the effort required to test a code base

  4. provide a reminder to yourself.  You may see what you've written
     as obvious, but others may not.  It is useful to have a hint about
     what code may seem harder to understand by others, and then decide
     if some rework may be in order.

   But why another complexity analyzer?  Even though the McCabe analysis
tool already exists (`pmccabe'), I think the job it does is too rough
for gauging complexity, though it is ideal for gauging the testing
effort.  Each code path should be tested and the `pmccabe' program
provides a count of code paths.  That, however, is not the only issue
affecting human comprehension.  This program attempts to take into
account other factors that affect a human's ability to understand.

1.1 Code Length
===============

Since `pmccabe' does not factor code length into its score, some folks
have taken to saying either long functions or a high McCabe score find
functions requiring attention.  But it means looking at two factors
without any visibility into how the length is obfuscating the code.

   The technique used by this program is to count 1 for each line that a
statement spans, plus the complexity score of control expressions
(`for', `while', and `if' expressions).  The value for a block of code
is the sum of these multiplied by a nesting factor (*note complexity
nesting-penalty::).  This score is then added to the score of the
encompassing block.  With all other things equal, a procedure that is
twice as long as another will have double the score.  `pmccabe' scores
them identically.

1.2 Switch Statement
====================

`pmccabe' has changed the scoring of `switch' statements because they
seemed too high.  `switch' statements are now "free" in this new
analysis.  That's wrong, too.  The code length needs to be counted and
the code within a `switch' statement adds more to the difficulty of
comprehension than code at a shallower logic level.

   This program will multiply the score of the `switch' statement
content by the *Note nesting score factor: complexity nesting-penalty.

1.3 Logic Conditions
====================

`pmccabe' does not score logic conditions very well.  It overcharges
for simple logical operations, it doesn't charge for comma operators,
and it undercharges for mixing assignment operators and relational
operators and the `and' and `or' logical operators.

   For example:
     xx = (A && B) || (C && D) || (E && F);
   scores as `6'.  Strictly speaking, there are, indeed, six code paths
there.  That is a fairly straight forward expression that is not nearly
as complicated as this:
       if (A) {
         if (B) {
           if (C) {
             if (D)
               a-b-c-and-d;
           } else if (E) {
               a-b-no_c-and-e;
           }
         }
       }
   and yet this scores exactly the same.  This program reduces the cost
to very little for a sequence of conditions at the same level.  (That
is, all `and' operators or all `or' operators.)  so the raw score for
these examples are 4 and 35, respectively (1 and 2 after scaling, *note
`--scale': complexity scale.).

   If you nest boolean expressions, there is a little cost, assuming you
parenthesize grouped expressions so that `and' and `or' operators do
not appear at the same parenthesized level.  Also assuming that you do
not mix assignment and relational and boolean operators all together.
If you do not parenthesize these into subexpressions, their small
scores get multiplied in ways that sometimes wind up as a much higher
score.

   The intent here is to encourage easy to understand boolean
expressions.  This is done by,
   * not combining them with assignment statements

   * canonicalizing them (two level expressions with all `&&' operators
     at the bottom level and all `||' operators in the nested level -\-
     or vice versa)

   * parenthesizing for visual clarity (relational operations
     parenthesized before being joined into larger `&&' or `||'
     expressions)

   * breaking them up into multiple `if' statements, if convenient.

1.4 Personal Experience
=======================

I have used `pmccabe' on a number of occasions.  For a first order
approximation, it does okay.  However, I was interested in zeroing in
on the modules that needed the most help and there were a lot of
modules needing help.  I was finding I was looking at some functions
where I ought to have been looking at others.  So, I put this together
to see if there was a better correlation between what seemed like hard
code to me and the score derived by an analysis tool.

   This has worked much better.  I ran `complexity' and `pmccabe'
against several million lines of code.  I correlated the scores.  Where
the two tools disagreed noticeably in relative ranking, I took a closer
look.  I found that `complexity' did, indeed, seem to be more
appropriate in its scoring.

1.5 Rationale Summary
=====================

Ultimately, complexity is in the eye of the beholder and, even, the
particular mood of the beholder, too.  It is difficult to tune a tool
to properly accommodate these variables.

   `complexity' will readily score as zero functions that are extremely
simple, and code that is long with many levels of logic nesting will
wind up scoring much higher than with `pmccabe', barring extreme
changes to the default values for the tunables.

   I have included several adjustments so that scores can be tweaked to
suit personal taste or gathered experience.  (*Note nesting score
factor: complexity nesting-penalty, and *note nested expression scoring
factor: complexity demi-nesting-penalty, but also *Note normalization
scaling factor: complexity scale, to adjust scores to approximate
scores rendered by `pmccabe').

2 Complexity Computation
************************

The principal goal Fundamentally, this program counts lines of
non-comment source lines, multiplies by a "nesting factor" for each
level of logic nesting and divides by a scaling factor so that the
typical results lie roughly in the same range as `pmccabe' results.
That happens to be approximately 20.

2.1 Parsing Method
==================

The method chosen for parsing the source has an effect on what gets
seen (scored) by the program.

2.1.1 Complexity Measurement Parsing
------------------------------------

This program examines the actual source a human looks at when the file
is opened, provided it is not pre-processed by `unifdef', *Note
`unifdef': complexity unifdef.  This was chosen because uncompiled code
adds to the complexity of what a human must understand.  However,
sometimes the source will contain unbalanced braces a la:
     #if FOO
       for (int ix = foo;;) {
     #else
       for (int ix = bar;;) {
     #endif
         code...
       }
   rendering code that cannot be parsed correctly.  `unifdef'-ing makes
it parsable.  Unfortunately, because the practice of `ifdef'-ing
unbalanced curly braces is so common, this program cannot rely on
finding the correct closing brace.

   *CAVEAT*: for the purposes of this program, procedures end when
either a matching closing brace is found _or_ a closing curly brace is
found in column 1, whichever comes first.  If the closing brace in
column one does not match the procedure opening brace, the procedure is
considered unscorable.

   Fortunately, unscorable procedures are relatively unusual.

   *CAVEAT2*: K&R procedure headers are not recognized.  If anything
other than an opening curly brace appears after the parameter list will
cause the code recognizer to go back into "look for a procedure header"
mode.  K&R procedures are not just not scored, they are completely
ignored.

   This should probably get fixed, though.

2.1.2 Post-PreProcessing Parsing
--------------------------------

Another approach would be to use the `C' compiler and analize the
tokens coming out of the preprocessor.  The drawbacks are that macro
expansions will add to the complexity, even though they do not add to
human perceived complexity, and uncompiled code do not add to the
complexity measure.  The benefit, of course, is that you know for
certain where a procedure body starts and ends.

2.1.3 During PreProcessing Parsing
----------------------------------

This would require going into the C preprocessor code and cause macros
to not be expanded.  Again, the great benefit is that you know for
certain you can find the starting and ending braces for every procedure
body.  The downsides are the extra work and, again, the uncompiled code
won't get counted in the complexity measure.

   This might be a useful exercise to do some day, just to see how
helpful it might be.  Being able to recognize all procedure bodies
without fail would be a good thing.

2.1.4 `pmccabe' Parsing
-----------------------

The `pmccabe' parsing actually inspired the method for this program.
Thd difference is that `pmccabe' will always keep scanning until a
procedure body's closing curly brace is found, even if that means
counting the code from several following procedure definitions.  The
consequence of this is that this program's code will see some
procedures that `pmccabe' will not, and vice versa.

2.2 Complexity Measurement Algorithm
====================================

Fundamentally, this program counts non-comment source lines and
examines elements of parenthesized expressions.  This score is
multiplied by a nesting scoring factor for each layer of code nesting.

   A parenthesized expression is scanned for operators.  If they are all
arithmetic operators, or all arithmetic and one relational operator,
the score is zero.  If all the operators are boolean `and's or they are
all `or's, then the score is one.  An assignment operator with
arithmetic operators also scores one.  If you mix relational operators
and all `and's or all `or's, the score is the number of boolean
elements.  If you mix `and's and `or's at the same parenthetical level,
the two counts are multiplied, unless the boolean element count is
higher.

   Fundamentally, do not use multiple relational or boolean operators at
the same parenthetical level, unless they are all boolean `and's or
they are all boolean `or's.  If you use boolean operators and
relational operators in one expression, you are charged one statement
for each boolean element.

   After scoring each statement and any parenthesized expressions, the
score is multiplied by any encompassing controlled block and added to
the score of that block.  A "controlled block" is a curly-braced
collection of statements controlled by one of the statement controlling
statements `do', `for', `else', `if', `switch', or `while'.  Stand
alone blocks for scoping local variables do not trigger the multiplier.

   You may trace the scores of parenthesized expressions and code
blocks (*note trace output file: complexity trace.).  You will see the
raw score of the code block or expression.

   The final score is the outermost score divided by the "scaling
factor", *Note complexity scaling factor: complexity scale.

2.3 Complexity Scores
=====================

The "Complexity Scores" table shows the score of each procedure
identified that also exceeded the threshold score, *Note --threshold:
complexity threshold.  The entries on each line are:

   * The computed score

   * The number of lines between the opening and closing curly braces

   * The number of non-comment, non-blank lines found there

   * The name of the source file

   * The line number of the opening curly brace

   * The name of the procedure

   The output is sorted by the score and then the number of non-comment
lines.  Procedures with scores below the threshold are not displayed.

2.4 Complexity Statistics
=========================

The statistics are displayed both as a table and as a histogram, *Note
Example Output::.  It is under the control of the *note --histogram:
complexity histogram. option.  The statistics are for each non-comment
source line and each source line is given the score of its encompassing
procedure.  This way, larger procedures are given proportionally more
weight than one line procedures.

   The histogram is broken up into three ranges.  Scores of 0 through 99
are displayed in 10 point groupings, 100 through 999 in 100 point
groupings and 1000 and above (good grief!!, but they exist) are in 1000
point groupings.  The number of asterisks represent the number of lines
of code that are in procedures that score in the specified range.

   The tabular statistics are also based on lines, not procedures.
`Average line score'
     This is the procedure score times the non-comment line count, all
     added up and divided by the total non-comment source lines found.

`25%-ile score'
`50%-ile score'
`75%-ile score'
`Highest score'
     Since the distribution of scores is nothing like a bell curve, the
     mean and standard deviation do not give a very clear picture of
     the distribution of the scores.  Typically, the standard deviation
     is larger than the average score.  So, instead the program prints
     the the four quartile scores.  The score for which 25, 50, and 75
     percent of code is scored less than, plus the highest scoring
     procedure (100 percent of code scores less than or equal to that
     score).

`Unscored procedures'
     If any procedures were found that could not be scored, the number
     of such procedures is printed.

2.5 Scoring Adjustments
=======================

Scores can be adjusted with three different options:
`nesting-penalty'
     *Note --nesting-penalty: complexity nesting-penalty.

`demi-nesting-penalty'
     *Note --demi-nesting-penalty: complexity demi-nesting-penalty.

`scale'
     *Note --scale: complexity scale.

   The raw score is the number of lines or statements, whichever is
greater, adjusted by a factor for the depth of the logic.  Statements
are nested when they are inside of a block of statements for a "block"
statement (viz., "do", "for", "if", "switch" or "while").  Statements
within blocks used to constrain the scope of variables (not controlled
by a block statement) are not multiplied by this factor.

   Expressions are nested when contained within parentheses.  The cost
of these is different.  Block level nesting multiplies the score for
the block by the `--nesting-penalty' factor (2.0 by default).  Nested
expressions are multiplied by the `--demi-nesting-penalty', the square
root of `--nesting-penalty' by default.

   Some attempt is made to judge the complexity of an expression.  A
complicated expression is one that contains an assignment operator,
more than one relation operator, or a mixture of "and" and "or"
operators with any other different kind of non-arithmetic operator.
Expression scores are minimized by:

   * Doing assignments outside of boolean expressions, or at least
     parenthesizing them.

   * Parenthesizing each relationship operation in an expression of
     multiple "and" and/or "or" operations.  Yes, precedence parses
     them correctly, but it is less clear.

   * Parenthesizing groups of "and" and "or" operations so that
     operators of only one type appear at one level.  For example, the
     first expression below instead of the second.  Yes, precedence
     means the effect is the same, but we're after code clarity so that
     correctness is more obvious.
          1: ((a && b) || (c && d))
          2: (a && b || c && d)
     The first adds 2 to the raw score (before dividing by the scaling
     factor).  The latter will add 5, assuming a `demi-nesting-penalty'
     of `1.41'.

3 Example Output
****************

This is a self-referential example. This output was obtained by going
into the complexity source directory and running the command:
     complexity --histogram --score --thresh=3 '*.c'

   The `--threshold' is set to three because all of the functions score
below the default threshold of 30.  It is not zero because there are
too many trivial (0, 1 or 2) functions for a short example.

This results in:

4 Invoking complexity
*********************

Compute the complexity of source code not just with a
path-through-the-code count, but also amplifying line counts by logic
level nesting.  `complexity' ignores all cpp preprocessor directives -
calculating the complexity of the appearance of the code, rather than
the complexity after the preprocessor manipulates the code.
`getchar(3)', for example, will expand into quite complicated code.

4.2 demi-nesting-penalty option
===============================

This is the "score multiplier for nested expressions" option.  By
default, this value is halfway between 1.0 and the nesting penalty
(specifically, the square root of the nesting penalty).  It refers to a
parenthesized sub-expression. e.g.
    ((a > b) && (c > d))
   contains two parenthesized sub-expressions.  This would count 3.5
points.  On the other hand, this:
    (a > b && c > d)
   contains two relation operators and a logical operator at the same
level.  These nested counts will be multiplied together and yield `2.5
* 2.5', or `6.25'.  Don't do that.  It gets even worse if you have
logical ands and ors at the same level.

4.3 histogram option (-h)
=========================

This is the "display histogram of complexity numbers" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   Instead of printing out each function's score, a summary is printed
at the end showing how many functions had particular ranges of scores.
Unless `--scores' is specifically called out, the scores will not print
with this option specified.  The minimum scoring threshold will also be
reduced to zero (0), unless `--threshold' is specified.

4.4 horrid-threshold option
===========================

This is the "zero exit threshold" option.  If any procedures score
higher than this threshold, then the program will exit non-zero.
(`4/COMPLEX_EXIT_HORRID_FUNCTION', if no other problems are
encountered.)  By default, this program exits zero unless one function
exceeds the horrid score of 100.

4.5 ignore option (-I)
======================

This is the "procedure name to be ignored" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   Some code has macros defined that confuse the lexical analysis.
This will cause them to be ignored.  Other ways to cause functions to
be ignored are:
  1. Use K&R syntax for a procedure header.

  2. Use a preprocessing macro to assemble the procedure header.

  3. Simplify your code.
        Generally speaking, anything you do that alters normal C syntax
will confuse the lexical analysis.  If a procedure is not seen, then it
will not get counted.  If code within a procedure is incomprehensible,
you will likely get inappropriate results.

4.6 input option (-i)
=====================

This is the "file of file list" option.  Instead of either a command
line list of input files or reading them from standard input, read the
list of files from this file.

4.7 nesting-penalty option (-n)
===============================

This is the "score multiplier for nested code" option.  Linguistic
constructs weigh more heavily the more deeply nested they are.  By
default, each layer penalizes by a factor of 2.0.  The option argument
is a floating point number.  The penalty may be 1, but not less.

4.8 no-header option (-H)
=========================

This is the "do not print scoring header" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   If a script is going to process the scoring output, parsing is easier
without a header.  The histogram output will always have a header.

4.9 scale option (-s)
=====================

This is the "complexity scaling factor" option.  By default, the
scaling is 20 which divides the raw score by 20.  This was normalized
to roughly correspond to the `pmccabe' scores:

`0-9'
     Easily maintained code.

`10-19'
     Maintained with little trouble.

`20-29'
     Maintained with some effort.

`30-39'
     Difficult to maintain code.

`40-49'
     Hard to maintain code.

`50-99'
     Unmaintainable code.

`100-199'
     Crazy making difficult code.

`200+'
     I only wish I were kidding.
         Score | ln-ct | nc-lns| file-name(line): proc-name
          4707    3815    2838   lib/vasnprintf.c(1747): VASNPRINTF

4.10 scores option (-c)
=======================

This is the "display the score for each procedure" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   If you specify `--histogram', individual scores will not be
displayed, unless this option is specified.

4.11 threshold option (-t)
==========================

This is the "reporting threshold" option.  Ignore any procedures with a
complexity measure below this threshold.  By default, a complexity
score of under 30 is not printed.  However, if a histogram and
statistics are to be printed, but not individual procedure scores, then
the default is set to zero.  Procedures below this limit are not
counted in the statistics.

4.12 trace option
=================

This is the "trace output file" option.  Print intermediate scores to a
trace file.

4.13 unif-exe option
====================

This is the "specify the unifdef program" option.  Alternate program to
use for unifdef-ing the input.

4.14 unifdef option (-u)
========================

This is the "run the source(s) through unifdef(1bsd)" option.

   This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   Strip out sections of code surrounded by `#if/#endif' directives.
The option argument is passed as an argument to the `unifdef(1BSD)'
program.  For example:
    complexity -u-Dsymbol
   would cause `symbol' to be defined and remove sections of code
preceded by `#ifndef symbol' directives.

   Please see the `unifdef' documentation for more information.

4.15 presetting/configuring complexity
======================================

Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be preset by
loading values from configuration ("rc" or "ini") files, and values
from environment variables named `COMPLEXITY' and
`COMPLEXITY_<OPTION_NAME>'. "`<OPTION_NAME>'" must be one of the
options listed above in upper case and segmented with underscores.  The
`COMPLEXITY' variable will be tokenized and parsed like the command
line.  The remaining variables are tested for existence and their
values are treated like option arguments.

   `libopts' will search in 4 places for configuration files:
   * $(pkgdatadir)/complex.conf

   * $HOME

   * $PROJECT_ROOT/complex.conf

   * $PWD
   The value for `$(pkgdatadir)' is recorded at package configure time
and replaced by `libopts' when `complexity' runs.  The environment
variables `HOME', `PROJECT_ROOT', and `PWD' are expanded and replaced
when `complexity' runs.  For any of these that are plain files, they
are simply processed.  For any that are directories, then a file named
`.complexityrc' is searched for within that directory and processed.

   Configuration files may be in a wide variety of formats.  The basic
format is an option name followed by a value (argument) on the same
line.  Values may be separated from the option name with a colon, equal
sign or simply white space.  Values may be continued across multiple
lines by escaping the newline with a backslash.

   Multiple programs may also share the same initialization file.
Common options are collected at the top, followed by program specific
segments.  The segments are separated by lines like:
    [COMPLEXITY]
   or by
    <?program complexity>
   Do not mix these within one configuration file.

   Compound values and carefully constructed string values may also be
specified using XML syntax:
    <option-name>
       <sub-opt>...&lt;...&gt;...</sub-opt>
    </option-name>
   yielding an `option-name.sub-opt' string value of
    "...<...>..."
   `AutoOpts' does not track suboptions.  You simply note that it is a
hierarchicly valued option.  `AutoOpts' does provide a means for
searching the associated name/value pair list (see: optionFindValue).

4.16 complexity exit codes
==========================

One of the following exit values will be returned:
`0'
     Successful program execution.

`1'
     The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

`3'
     insufficient memory to run program

`4'
     One or more functions scored over 100

`5'
     No qualifying procedures were found.

`32'
     one or more input files were unreadable or empty.

4.17 complexity Description
===========================

The weight of each statement is the number of lines the statement uses.
This value is multiplied by the nested logic weighting (2.0 by default)
for each layer of logic.  For example, this snippet:

    if (foo) {
      if (bar) {
        bumble; baz;
      }
    }

   will score 11.  This score is then scaled to approximate `pmccabe'
results by dividing by 20 and rounding.  This scores "1" at the end.
`pmccabe' scores higher on simple procedures and `complexity' scores
higher with more deeply nested logic.

   The scoring can be tweaked by adjusting the `--nesting-penalty' and
`--scale'-ing factors.  The default values were calibrated by comparing
the average results of millions of lines of code with the results of
`pmccabe'.

   For the purposes of this program, a procedure is identified by a name
followed by a parenthesized expression and then an opening curly brace.
It ends with a closing curly brace in column 1.

4.18 complexity Bugs
====================

This program does not recognize K&R procedure headers.

   Some procedures still get missed.  Usually, these are procedures
that use the C pre-processor to extend the C language in some way.

Appendix A Copying This Manual
******************************

You may copy this manual under the terms of the FDL (the GNU Free
Documentation License (http://gnu.org/licenses/fdl.texi)).

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

    Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    `http://fsf.org/'

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

      Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
      Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
      Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

        with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
        the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
        being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
