GNU Source Release Collection
*****************************

This manual is for GNU Source Release Collection (version 2014.10.11, 6
January 2014).

1 Introduction
**************

The GNU Source Release Collection (GSRC) provides a simple way to
install the latest GNU packages on an existing distribution.  By using
GSRC, the GNU source packages from 'ftp.gnu.org' are automatically
downloaded, compiled and installed, either in your home directory or a
system-wide directory such as '/opt'.

   At its core, it is a presentation of the current state of the GNU
system, in the most appropriate form: buildable and installable source
code.  GSRC makes it easy to discover great new software from the GNU
system, as well as providing other benefits over standard software
distributions.  It allows you, for example, to install easily GNU
software for yourself on a system on which you do not have permission to
install software system-wide; or to install the latest, unpatched
packages when those distributed with your operating system are outdated
or not configured to your liking.

   GSRC is based on the GAR build system by Nick Moffitt and the GARstow
enhancements by Adam Sampson.  GAR was inspired by BSD Ports, a
Makefile-based build system, and is written in GNU Make.  The GARNOME
build system for GNOME was another example of a system using GAR.

   Note that GSRC is not intended to be a full package-management system
or source distribution.  It is just a more convenient way to compile GNU
packages from source on an existing system.

   Because GSRC is not a full distribution you will sometimes need to
install other packages from your distribution to build and run GNU
programs.  For example, GSRC itself does not include Perl or Python, so
you will need to make sure these are already installed for GNU programs
which use them.

1.1 Building GNU packages
=========================

If you have never built a GNU package by hand, this section will briefly
show the process so you will have an idea of what GSRC is doing.  If you
are already familiar with this, you may skip this section.

   The build process is performed via commands entered into a shell,
which is generally done in a terminal or a terminal emulator.  The
dollar sign in the following examples represents the "shell prompt",
denoting the point at which you enter commands, while the characters
following the prompt show the commands that you must enter.  While much
of the build process is conveniently automated, such that you do not
need to manually compile every file, you still must take a few steps.

   For example, to build the package "hello" version 2.9, you must
perform the following steps in your terminal:

  1. Download the package and unpack it
          $ wget http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.9.tar.gz
          $ tar xvfz hello-2.9.tar.gz

  2. Run the 'configure' script
          $ cd hello-2.9
          $ ./configure

  3. Compile the source code
          $ make

  4. Install it
          $ make install

   In some unfortunate cases, the process is not as straight-forward and
may require some extra intervention on your part.  GSRC abstracts away
most of these steps so that all you need to enter to install a program
is 'make install'.

2 Getting started
*****************

GSRC is distributed directly using the Bazaar version control system or
via a compressed archive.  You can check out the latest version from the
Bazaar repository using

     $ bzr checkout bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/gsrc/trunk/ gsrc

This will create a directory 'gsrc'.  The build definitions for GNU
packages are in the 'gnu' subdirectory.  Large sub-projects, such as
GNOME, have their own subdirectory containing packages (i.e.  'gnome').
The 'external' subdirectory contains references to dependencies which
you may have to install outside of GSRC, such as via your GNU/Linux
distribution's package manager (APT, Pacman, Yum, etc.).  If these
dependencies are required for a given package and are not found on your
system, you will be automatically notified.  Finally, the
'decommissioned' directory contains former GNU packages that have been
decommissioned.

   Each package has its own subdirectory within its parent directory,
for example 'gnu/emacs' or 'gnome/evince'.  Package directories contain
a 'config.mk' file for configuring the package and a 'Makefile' for
building it.  This 'Makefile' will automate the usual './configure' and
'make' commands needed to build a GNU package.

   To stay up-to-date with the latest releases of GNU software, you can
pull in recent changes to your local copy of GSRC:

     $ bzr update

   Alternatively, quarter-annual "snapshots" of GSRC are made available
for download at <http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/gsrc>.

2.1 Initial setup
=================

If you have checked out the source tree from the Bazaar repository you
will need to create the build files with the following command,

     $ ./bootstrap

   Before building any packages you will need to run the top-level
configure script.  There is only one configuration parameter, the
installation prefix, specified with '--prefix'.  For example, to install
all the compiled packages under '/gnu' use:

     $ ./configure --prefix=/gnu
     checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
     checking whether build environment is sane... yes
     checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /usr/bin/mkdir -p
     checking for gawk... gawk
     checking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes
     checking whether make supports nested variables... yes
     checking for recsel... /usr/bin/recsel
     checking for recfmt... /usr/bin/recfmt
     checking that generated files are newer than configure... done
     configure: creating ./config.status
     config.status: creating gsrc
     config.status: creating config.mk
     config.status: creating setup.sh
     config.status: creating GNUmakefile
     config.status: creating doc/Makefile

   You can optionally install the documentation and the 'gsrc' script
(*note Finding packages::).  Note that these are installed to the
directory specified in the previous step.  Be sure to set your
environment to be able to use them (*note Setting your environment::).

     $ make install

2.2 Building a simple package
=============================

All interaction with GSRC is performed via the program Make.  When you
execute Make via the 'make' command, you generally must provide a
"target" that tells Make which "recipe", consisting of a series of
pre-defined commands, to execute.  For example, the 'build' target will
tell Make to execute a recipe to build the software, while the 'install'
target will execute a recipe for installing it.  Often, a default recipe
will be available that will typically build the software, allowing you
to omit the 'build' target.

   Thus, in GSRC, to build any package, type 'make build' (or, simply
'make') in the package's subdirectory.  You can change to the directory
with the 'cd' command in the shell, or with the '-C' option of 'make'.
For example, to build the "hello" package in the 'gnu/hello'
subdirectory from the root GSRC directory use:

     $ make -C gnu/hello

   This will download, unpack, configure and build the "hello" package.
The package will be built in the subdirectory 'gnu/hello/work'.

     $ ./gnu/hello/work/hello-2.9/src/hello
     Hello, world!

2.3 Installing a package
========================

You are now ready to install the package.  If you are installing to a
new directory tree, first create the directory specified in the
top-level configure '--prefix' option if necessary,

     $ mkdir /gnu

   Then to install the package use the 'install' target,

     $ make -C gnu/hello install

   The package should be automatically installed under '/gnu', with any
executable programs under '/gnu/bin/'.

     $ /gnu/bin/hello --version
     hello (GNU hello) 2.9

2.4 Setting your environment
============================

If you want to use the newly installed package without having to specify
its full path, you will need to modify the relevant variables in your
environment, such as 'PATH', 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH', 'INFOPATH', etc.  These
variables inform your system of the locations of relevant files on it.
For example, 'PATH' contains a list of all directories that contain
executable files.

   There is a sample script 'setup.sh' in the top-level GSRC directory
which can be used to set the main environment variables.

     $ source setup.sh

   Note that you need to load this file into the current shell with the
'source' command, instead of executing it (which would only apply the
definitions temporarily in a subshell).

   After loading this file, your environment variables should include
the target directory so you can run the new packages directly:

     $ echo $PATH
     /gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
     $ which hello
     /gnu/bin/hello

   If you want to restore your original environment variables they are
saved in the variables 'ORIG_PATH', 'ORIG_LD_LIBRARY_PATH', etc.

     $ PATH=$ORIG_PATH
     $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORIG_LD_LIBRARY_PATH

2.5 Useful targets
==================

To clean up the build directory and delete any downloaded files, use the
'clean' target:

     $ make -C gnu/hello clean

   There are other useful targets.  For example, the whole build
sequence can be broken down into stages as follows:

     $ make -C gnu/hello fetch checksum extract configure build install

   Each target depends on the previous one, so typing 'make -C gnu/hello
install' executes all the earlier targets first.

   You can install the source code of a package (to, i.e.,
'/gnu/src/hello-2.9') using the 'install-src' target.  Likewise, the
source can be removed using the 'uninstall-src' target.

   To see some information about a package, use the target 'pkg-info'.

     $ make -C gnu/hello pkg-info
     make: Entering directory `/home/gnu/gsrc/gnu/hello'
     Name:        GNU Hello
     Version:     2.9
     URL:         http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/
     Description:
      GNU Hello prints the message "Hello, world!" and then exits.  It
      serves as an example of standard GNU coding practices.  As such, it
      supports command-line arguments, multiple languages, and so on.
     Status:      installed (stowed)
     make: Leaving directory `/home/gnu/gsrc/gnu/hello'

   The "Status" can be any of: "not installed", "installed (not stowed)"
or "installed (stowed)" (*note Package versions::).

   To view a more concise summary, ideal for producing a list of
packages in script, use the target 'pkg-info-curt'.

     $ make -C gnu/hello pkg-info-curt
     make: Entering directory `/home/gnu/gsrc/gnu/hello'
     gnu/hello 2.9
      A program that produces a familiar, friendly greeting
     make: Leaving directory `/home/gnu/gsrc/gnu/hello'

   To get a better idea of what files will be downloaded and which
dependencies must be built in order to use a package, use the
'fetch-list' target.

     $ make -C gnu/hello fetch-list
     make: Entering directory `/home/gnu/gsrc/gnu/hello'
     Name: hello
     Version: 2.9
     Location: http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/hello/
     Distribution files:
     	hello-2.9.tar.gz
     Patch files:
     Signature files:
     	hello-2.9.tar.gz.sig
     Dependencies:
     make: Leaving directory `/home/gnu/gsrc/gnu/hello'

   Most GNU packages are highly configurable.  To see which
configuration options are available to you, you may invoke the
'help-config' target.

   Finally, if you choose to remove a package, you may use the
'uninstall' target.  This target "un-stows" the package; if you were to
re-install it, the package would not need to be re-built.  Instead, it
would merely be re-stowed.  To completely remove a package, use the
'uninstall-pkg' target.  When you update a package to a new version, the
old version is merely un-stowed and the new version is installed
alongside it (*note Package versions::).  In order to clean out old
package versions, use the 'uninstall-pkg-old' target.

2.6 Complex packages
====================

If building or using a package depends on other GNU packages, these will
be built automatically in the correct order.  To see the dependencies of
any package use the 'dep-list' target.

     $ make -C gnu/gnupg dep-list
     make: Entering directory `/home/gnu/gsrc/gnu/gnupg'
     libgpg-error libgcrypt libassuan libksba pth zlib readline
     make: Leaving directory `/home/gnu/gsrc/gnu/gnupg'

   The dependencies are searched for in the 'gnu', 'gnustep' and 'gnome'
subdirectories by default.  Of course, packages might depend on software
that does not belong to the GNU project.  In those cases, GSRC will try
to determine whether these external packages are installed on your
system.  If one is not present, you will have to install it separately,
for example via your distribution's software repositories.

   Note that the dependencies can be more than one level deep,

     $ make -C gnu/readline dep-list
     make: Entering directory `/home/gnu/gsrc/gnu/readline'
     ncurses
     make: Leaving directory `/home/gnu/gsrc/gnu/readline'

   So, to install a complex package like "gnupg" use the same commands
as for a simple package,

     $ make -C gnu/gnupg
     $ make -C gnu/gnupg install

   All of the dependencies (and the dependencies' dependencies) will be
built and installed first, as needed.

2.7 Finding packages
====================

GSRC provides build recipes for several hundred packages.  So, how can
you find or discover a package relevant to your needs?  Fortunately, the
build recipes are described by metadata, which can help you in
searching.  For example, you can use standard GNU tools such as 'grep'
to search the text of the build recipes for key words.

   A template script is installed, called 'gsrc', that provides a simple
means for searching for packages via keywords, printing information
about a package, and printing its location.  Since 'gsrc' is installed
to the same location as executables installed by GSRC, if you have set
up your environment to use GSRC packages (*note Setting your
environment::), you can use the 'gsrc' script to access GSRC from
outside the GSRC directory.

   For example, here we search for an editor, discover the program
"moe", read information about it, and then install it.

     $ gsrc search editor
     gnu/denemo 1.0.0
      A music notation editor
     gnu/ed 1.7
      An implementation of the standard Unix editor
     gnu/emacs 24.3
      The extensible, customizable text editor
     gnu/global 6.2.8
      A source code tag system
     gnu/gnusound 0.7.5
      A multitrack sound editor
     gnu/leg
      Libraries for game engines and game development
     gnu/less 451
      A pager
     gnu/mc 4.6.1
      A two-paned file manager
     gnu/mit-scheme 9.1.1
      An implementation of the Scheme programming language
     gnu/moe 1.5
      A simple-to-use text editor
     gnu/nano 2.3.2
      A simple text editor
     gnu/sed 4.2.2
      A text stream editor
     $ gsrc info moe
     Name:        Moe
     Version:     1.5
     URL:         http://www.gnu.org/software/moe
     Description:
      GNU Moe is a powerful-but-simple-to-use text editor.  It works in a
      modeless manner, and features an intuitive set of key-bindings that
      assign a degree of "severity" to each key; for example key
      combinations with the Alt key are for harmless commands like cursor
      movements while combinations with the Control key are for commands
      that will modify the text.  Moe features multiple windows, unlimited
      undo/redo, unlimited line length, global search and replace, and
      more.
     Status:      not installed
     $ make -C $(gsrc path moe) install

   If you view the 'gsrc' script's code, you will find that it is very
simple and, indeed, can be used as a template to be expanded to include
the functionality that you desire.

   More robust searching can be performed with the file 'MANIFEST.rec'.
If you have acquired GSRC by downloading it as a 'tar.gz' archive, this
file should be present in the package's root directory.  If you have
acquired GSRC by cloning its code repository, you will have to generate
this file.  Simply navigate to the package's root directory and enter
'make manifest'; you will want to run this every time you pull updates
to the repository.  The resulting file is a "recfile", which can be
queried as a database using GNU Recutils, which must be installed (*note
(recutils)recsel::).

3 Advanced configuration
************************

The default behavior of GSRC may be configured both globally and for
individual packages.  All configuration is done in simple Makefiles, so
some familiarity with GNU Make, while not required, is recommended for
more advanced changes.

3.1 Global configuration
========================

Building a package loads the following configuration files:

'config.mk'
     Specifies the installation directory prefix.  Created by the
     configure script from 'config.mk.in'
'gar.conf.mk'
     Specifies general configuration variables
'gar.env.mk'
     Defines the environment variables that are set during each build
     step.
'gar.master.mk'
     Defines the list of mirror sites used to download the source
     tarballs.  It is recommended to modify this to use local mirrors.
'gar.site.mk'
     An optional file that you can create to load extra recipes to use
     on packages.  This file must be created by the user (however, it is
     not an eroror if the file does not exist).

   Much of the behavior of GSRC is defined by variables that can be
customized.  Generally speaking, you should override these variables in
your 'config.mk' file rather than in the 'gar.*.mk' files.  That way,
you do not have to worry about updates to GSRC overwriting your changes.

   Some of the more important configuration variables are:

'BOOTSTRAP'
     If defined (the default), the environment variables
     'C_INCLUDE_PATH', 'CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH' and 'LDFLAGS' point to the
     'include' and 'lib' subdirectories of the installation directory.
     This forces the use of any previously installed libraries in
     preference to the normal system libraries.  To disable this
     feature, remove the definition 'BOOTSTRAP=1' in 'config.mk.in' and
     rerun configure, or build with 'BOOTSTRAP' undefined on the
     command-line:

          $ make -C gnu/gnupg BOOTSTRAP=

     Set in 'conf.mk'

'IGNORE_DEPS'
     Specifies any packages that should be skipped as dependencies (for
     example, if you prefer to use existing system packages instead).  A
     space separated list.  Set in 'gar.conf.mk'.

'GARCHIVEDIR'
'GARBALLDIR'
     Specifies the directories used to cache downloaded source code
     archives ('GARCHIVEDIR') and the archives of the installed packages
     ('GARBALLDIR').  Set in 'gar.conf.mk'.

'MAKE_ARGS_PARALLEL'
     Set this to '-j N' to allow N parallel processes in the build.
     Note that multiple dependencies are built one-by-one; only the
     commands within each build are performed in parallel.  Set in
     'gar.conf.mk'

'USE_COLOR'
     It's easy to miss the messages printed by GSRC amongst all the
     output of the build process.  Set this to "y" to enable colorized
     output of GSRC messages, which may make them more visible.  Set it
     to anything else to disable color.  In either case, four more
     variables are defined: 'MSG', 'MSG2', 'ERR', 'OK' and 'OFF'.  The
     first four define strings to insert at the beginning of a normal
     message ('MSG', 'MSG2'), an error message ('ERR'), or a message
     indicating success ('OK').  The 'OFF' code is inserted at the end
     of the message.  When 'USE_COLOR' is "y", these variables contain
     ANSI escape sequences to change properties of the text (i.e.  to
     set colors or text weight).  Otherwise, they may contain textual
     indicators, such as "==> " to begin a message.  Some sensible
     default values for both cases are included.  Set in 'gar.conf.mk'.

'REDIRECT_OUTPUT'
     A typical build process produces a lot of textual output.  In some
     cases, you may wish to redirect this output to somewhere other than
     your screen.  In this case, you may set the variable
     'REDIRECT_OUTPUT' to any value other than "n".  To edit where the
     output will be redirected, set the 'OUTPUT' variable.  By default,
     if you set 'REDIRECT_OUTPUT', standard text output will be
     redirected to '/dev/null', which means it is thrown away, while
     errors will be printed to the screen.  You can instead, for
     example, redirect to log files of your choosing (*note
     (bash)Redirections:: for more details on redirection).  Set in
     'gar.conf.mk'

3.2 Package configuration
=========================

Each package can be customized to your liking.  Because GNU packages
follow a standardized build process, customizing the GSRC build for one
is straightforward.

   GNU packages take most of their configuration in the form of options
passed to the 'configure' script.  One may easily customize these
options in a GSRC Makefile by setting the 'CONFIGURE_OPTS' variable.
Any options added to this variable will be appended to the options set
by default by GSRC.

     CONFIGURE_OPTS = --disable-gtk --without-png

   For convenience, every package has a file called 'config.mk' in its
directory which is imported by its build script.  Typically, all user
configuration should be done here.  By default, it contains the
'CONFIGURE_OPTS' and 'BUILD_OPTS' variables.  In some special cases,
package-specific, user-customize-able variables are also defined in this
file.

   Generally speaking, user configuration is done exclusively in
'config.mk' while 'Makefile' contains the information and recipes
necessary for the package to build correctly.  Thus, you should not need
to modify the 'Makefile' unless you have special requirements.  Note
that most configuration options relating to directory locations (such as
where to install, where to search for libraries, etc.)  are set in the
'Makefile', because they are necessary for proper building and
installation in GSRC. Therefore, you do not need to worry about setting
them correctly in 'config.mk'.

3.3 Patching packages
=====================

If you have a patch that you would like to apply to a package, the
process can be automated by GSRC. First, in the package's directory,
make a subdirectory called 'files' and move the patch file(s) there.
Next, create two variables in the package's 'Makefile':

     PATCHFILES = my-patch.diff my-patch2.diff
     PATCHOPTS = -p0

   'PATCHFILES' holds a list of all the patch files in the 'files'
subdirectory.  'PATCHOPTS' contains the option switches to pass to the
'patch' program.

   Next, the patch file's checksum is added to the checksums file for
the package.

     $ make makesum

   Note that if the 'make makesums' command fails due to GPG
verification and you trust the source from which the package or patch
was downloaded, you may instead use 'make makesums GPGV=true' to skip
this key verification step.

   Finally, you may build the package as normal.  The patch(es) will be
applied automatically in the process.

     $ make install

   If the patching process fails and you are sure that the patch is for
the version of the package contained in GSRC, then you may have to
modify the '-p' option in the 'PATCHOPTS' variable (*note
(diffutils)patch Options::).

   If the package requires a patch to even build properly, then this is
a bug in GSRC. Please report such build problems to <bug-gsrc@gnu.org>.
You should also contact the maintainers of the software package to make
them aware of the problem.

3.4 Package versions
====================

What is actually happening "under the hood" when GSRC installs a package
is slightly more complicated than what has been described so far.

   When you install a package, it is first actually installed to the
'/gnu/packages' directory in a sub-directory with the name
<package>-<version> (i.e.  '/gnu/packages/hello-2.8').  In the example
of the package "hello", the executable 'hello' is installed to
'/gnu/packages/hello-2.8/bin/hello' instead of '/gnu/bin/hello'.  All
other files installed by the package are installed in a similar manner.
Next, GSRC makes symbolic links to those files inside the parent '/gnu'
directory.  Thus, '/gnu/bin/hello' is ultimately a symlink to
'/gnu/packages/hello-2.8/bin/hello'.  This is referred to as "stowing";
a package with symlinks to its files installed in the system is said to
be "stowed".

   When a new version of a package is released, you do not have to
uninstall the previous version first.  When "hello 2.9" is built and
installed, it is put into its own package directory,
'/gnu/packages/hello-2.9' and the directory of "hello 2.8" is left
untouched.  When GSRC finalizes the installation, the old symlinks are
removed and new ones are created to the latest version's files.  Thus,
while there would then actually be two versions of the package
installed, only the latest one would be stowed.

   If you want to stow a particular version of the package, you may pass
the 'GARVERSION' variable to 'make install'.  Be sure to update the
checksums when you do so, otherwise the process will fail!

     $ make -C gnu/hello makesum install GARVERSION=2.8

   If you had previously built version 2.8, then GSRC will merely
re-stow those files.  Of course, if you have not previously built it, or
if you have previously run 'make clean', the package will be built from
scratch.

   Note: this method may fail if the package naming format or
compression algorithm has changed between versions (i.e.  a change from
tar.gz to tar.xz); in this case you must also modify 'DISTFILES'.

   Users wishing to maintain different configurations of a package may
take advantage of the 'GARPROFILE' variable.  Its value is merely
appended to the package directory name, allowing you to have multiple
configurations of the same package version installed.  For example:

     $ make -C gnu/hello install CONFIGURE_OPTS="--disable-nls" GARPROFILE="-no-nls"

   This would install the newly configured package to
'/gnu/packages/hello-2.9-no-nls'.

Appendix A Technical information
********************************

This appendix gives detailed information on the GSRC build system.  This
information is not necessary for most users but it may be of interest to
developers and GSRC maintainers.

A.1 The GSRC build system
=========================

The GSRC build system is based on a system called GARstow by Adam
Sampson, which, in turn, was based on an earlier system called GAR by
Nick Moffitt.  In this section, the basic architecture of the GSRC build
system will be described.

   GSRC consists of several system Makefiles plus the Makefile for each
package.  When the user calls 'make' on a package's Makefile, the GSRC
system Makefiles are pulled in.  There are several of these system
Makefiles:

File               Description
                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
'gar.mk'           This file contains the top-level targets such as
                   'build' or 'install'.
                   
'gar.lib.mk'       This file contains recipes to perform the sub-tasks
                   for each top-level target (see below).
                   
'gar.master.mk'    This file contains master URLs for downloading
                   packages (i.e.  <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu>).
                   
'gar.lib'          This directory contains further Makefiles to define
                   common variable values for typical build systems,
                   such as the standard GNU Autotools process.
                   
'gar.conf.mk'      This file contains the general configuration of
                   GSRC.
                   
'gar.env.mk'       The variables in this file are used to properly set
                   the build environment for GSRC.
                   
'config.mk'        This file contains the user's particular GSRC
                   configuration.
                   

   The typical user-level GSRC Make targets, such as 'fetch', 'build' or
'install', come from 'gar.mk'.  Depending on the package's build
requirements, as defined in the package's GSRC Makefile, these
user-level targets will depend on lower-level targets that actually
perform the required tasks.

   For example, in a typical GNU package, configuration is done with a
'configure' script while building and installing are done with a
'Makefile'.  So, for the package "hello", the 'build' target will depend
on a target called 'build-work/hello-2.9/Makefile' ('build-' plus the
location of the 'Makefile' distributed with the package).  For a
Python-based package that is installed via a 'setup.py', the 'install'
target will depend on the target 'install-work/foo-1.0/setup.py'.  The
file 'gar.lib.mk' contains many generalized Make recipes to handle each
of these different scenarios.

   The directory 'gar.lib' contains Makefiles that set common variable
values for packages that share similar build systems.  It has a file
called 'auto.mk', for example, that defines the settings for a package
that uses the standard Autotools process.

A.2 Anatomy of a GSRC Makefile
==============================

GSRC Makefiles are the point of entry for the user into the GSRC system.
Since GSRC supplies GNU software and there are GNU coding standards that
dictate how package installation is supposed to work, the GSRC Makefiles
for most GNU software packages are similar.

   In order to facilitate working with the GSRC Makefiles in an
automated way, such as searching them via a script, they all share a
common structure, split into three sections: metadata variables, build
variables, and the build recipes.  By convention, these three sections
are separated by lines of seventy hash symbols ("#").  This helps to
visually separate the sections, as well as to provide convenient
stopping points when scanning or searching the files.

A.2.1 Metadata variables
------------------------

This section consists of variable declarations that describe the package
itself.  The following variables should be present:

Variable name      Description
                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
'NAME'             This is the common-language, official name of the
                   package.  It may contain multiple words and any
                   character.  Example: "GNU Source-highlight"
                   
'GARNAME'          This is the internal GSRC name of the package.  It
                   should match the name of the directory containing
                   the package and, by convention, for GNU packages it
                   is the name of the package's HTTP subdirectory on
                   <http://www.gnu.org/software>.  It should consist of
                   only lower case letters, numbers, hyphens or
                   underscores.  Example: "src-highlite"
                   
'UPSTREAMNAME'     [optional] If the package maintainers ever use a
                   different name for the package, for example a
                   different spelling or capitalization, include it
                   here.  This is often useful in specifying URLs or
                   package arcive names.  Example: "source-highlight"
                   
'GARVERSION'       This is the current version number of the package.
                   Example: "3.1.7"
                   
'DISTNAME'         [optional] This variable contains the distribution
                   name of the package.  This variable is automatically
                   constructed and by default it is
                   '$(GARNAME)-$(GARVERSION)'.  Example:
                   "src-highlite-3.1.7"
                   
'HOME_URL'         This is the home URL of the package, where a user
                   might find more information about it.  Example:
                   "http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite"
                   
'DESCRIPTION'      This variable should have a short, one-line
                   description of the package.
                   
'BLURB'            [optional] This should contain a longer, multi-line
                   description of the package.  To achieve this, its
                   value needs to be declared using the Make 'define'
                   statement.
                   

A.2.2 Build variables
---------------------

The second section of a GSRC Makefile holds variable definitions that
are used in the build process.  When possible, it is preferable to use
the metadata variables in the build variable definitions, to minimize
the number of items that need to be modified should anything change.

Variable name      Description
                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
'MASTER_SITES'     This variable defines the top-level URL from where
                   the package files should be retrieved.  Many URLs
                   are already defined in variables in the file
                   'gar.master.mk'.  Most GNU packages are retrievable
                   from <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu>, which is assigned to
                   the variable 'MASTER_GNU' in 'gar.master.mk', so for
                   a GNU package, 'MASTER_SITES' would be set to
                   '$(MASTER_GNU)'.  Multiple sites may be listed;
                   attempts to download a files will proceed for each
                   site listed until one succeeds.
                   
'MASTER_SUBDIR'    This is the directory of the master site under which
                   the package files can be found.  For most GNU
                   packages, this can simply be '$(GARNAME)/'.
                   
'DISTFILE_SITES'   This variable contains URL(s) from which source
                   distribution archives only are to be downloaded.
                   
'DISTFILE_SUBDIR'  This variable contains the sub-directory of
                   'DISTFILE_SITES' where the source distributions can
                   be found.
                   
'SIGFILE_SITES'    This variable contains URL(s) from which signature
                   files only are to be downloaded.
                   
'SIGFILE_SUBDIR'   This variable contains the sub-directory of
                   'SIGFILE_SITES' where the signature files can be
                   found.
                   
'PATCHFILE_SITES'  This variable contains URL(s) from which patch files
                   only are to be downloaded.
                   
'PATCHFILE_SUBDIR' This variable contains the sub-directory of
                   'DISTFILE_SITES' where the source distributions can
                   be found.
                   
'FILE_SITES'       This variable lists file URIs where files can be
                   found locally.  By default this contains the 'files'
                   sub-directory of the package's GSRC directory and
                   the location specified by the variable
                   'GARCHIVEDIR'.  Note that these URIs should be
                   prefaced with "file://".
                   
'DISTFILES'        This variable contains a space-separated list of all
                   of the source distribution archives to be fetched.
                   
'SIGFILES'         This variable contains a space-separated list of all
                   the signature files to fetch.
                   
'PATCHFILES'       This variable contains a space-separated list of all
                   the patch files to fetch.
                   
'WORKSRC'          This variable contains the name of the directory
                   where all of the work should take place.  Its
                   default value is '$(WORKDIR)/$(DISTNAME)', which
                   should be sufficient for most cases, so it is
                   normally not necessary to set this variable.  If,
                   however, the package's source archive extracts to a
                   directory with some other name, you should set it
                   here.  This should always begin with '$(WORKDIR)',
                   which by default is the 'work' subdirectory of the
                   GSRC package's sub-directory.
                   
'WORKOBJ'          This variable defines the location where the build
                   process should take place.  Normally, and by
                   default, this is the same as 'WORKSRC', however some
                   packages recommend building in a directory separate
                   from the location of the source code.
                   
'CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS'This variable contains a list of the scripts or
                   files that need to be run during the configuration
                   step of the build process.  Phony targets may also
                   be included.
                   
'BUILD_SCRIPTS'    This variable contains a list of the scripts or
                   files that need to be run during the build step of
                   the build process.  Phony targets may also be
                   included.
                   
'INSTALL_SCRIPTS'  This variable contains a list of the scripts or
                   files that need to be run during the install step of
                   the build process.  Phony targets may also be
                   included.
                   
'INFO_FILES'       This variable contains a list of all of the Info
                   documentation files installed by a program.  To use
                   this variable, you must include the 'info.mk' file
                   from the 'gar.lib' directory.  If this variable is
                   not defined and 'info.mk' is included, then it will
                   have a default value of '$(GARNAME).info'
                   
'BUILDDEPS'        This variable contains a space-separated list of the
                   programs required to build the package, using their
                   GARNAMEs.
                   
'LIBDEPS'          This variable is slightly a misnomer.  It is a
                   space-separated list of all the programs and/or
                   libraries required at run-time by the package.

A.2.3 Build recipes
-------------------

The final section of the GSRC Makefile contains the specifics of
building the package.  For most cases, it is sufficient to just add
'include ../../gar.lib/auto.mk', which will work for any package that
follows the GNU building and installation standards.  This will, among
other actions, automatically define the 'CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS',
'BUILD_SCRIPTS' and 'INSTALL_SCRIPTS' variables and it will include the
'gar.mk' Makefile.  If the package does not follow this building
standard, then add 'include ../../gar.mk' directly.  Following this, the
user's package configuration should be loaded with 'include config.mk'.

   Because there is the possibility that the user specify some
configuration options, any further options that must be set within the
Makefile should be done after the user configuration has been loaded.
By convention, whereas the user specifies options with the
'CONFIGURE_OPTS' and 'BUILD_OPTS' variables, inside the GSRC Makefile
options should be included by _appending_ to the 'CONFIGURE_ARGS' and
'BUILD_ARGS' variables:

     CONFIGURE_ARGS += --some-option

   Finally, if necessary, the actual recipes are written.  Note that if
'gar.lib/auto.mk' was included, no recipes should need to be written.
In general, there are two kinds of targets for which recipes may need to
be written.

   The first correspond to the files listed under 'CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS',
'BUILD_SCRIPTS' and 'INSTALL_SCRIPTS'.  As mentioned previously,
user-level targets, such as 'build', depend on lower-level targets such
as 'build-work/hello-2.9/Makefile'.  These are the targets that must be
implemented for each of the designated configure/build/install scripts.
For each target, a recipe is written using the normal Make syntax to
perform the necessary task.  Recall that phony targets may be specified
as configure/build/install scripts.  So, if 'INSTALL_SCRIPTS = java',
then a target named 'install-java' must be written.

   The second kind of targets that may be written are pre- and post-
rules.  These recipes are run before or after the specified top-level
target.  For example, a target called 'pre-build' is run immediately
before the 'build' target.  These targets are convenient for performing
pre- or post-processing on files.  Note that there are also
'pre-everything' and 'post-everything' targets that can be written.

A.2.4 A simple example
----------------------

     NAME = GNU Hello
     GARNAME = hello
     GARVERSION = 2.9
     HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/
     DESCRIPTION = A program that produces a familiar, friendly greeting
     define BLURB
     GNU Hello prints the message "Hello, world!" and then exits.  It
     serves as an example of standard GNU coding practices.  As such, it
     supports command-line arguments, multiple languages, and so on.

     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
