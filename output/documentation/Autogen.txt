The Automated Program Generator
*******************************

This file documents AutoGen version 5.18.  It is a tool designed for
generating program files that contain repetitive text with varied
substitutions.  This document is very long because it is intended as a
reference document.  For a quick start example, *Note Example Usage::.

   The AutoGen distribution includes the basic generator engine and
several add-on libraries and programs.  Of the most general interest
would be Automated Option processing, *Note AutoOpts::, which also
includes stand-alone support for configuration file parsing, *Note
Features::.  *Note Add-on packages for AutoGen: Add-Ons, section for
additional programs and libraries associated with AutoGen.

   This edition documents version 5.18, August 2015.

1 Introduction
**************

AutoGen is a tool designed for generating program files that contain
repetitive text with varied substitutions.  Its goal is to simplify the
maintenance of programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text.
This is especially valuable if there are several blocks of such text
that must be kept synchronized in parallel tables.

   An obvious example is the problem of maintaining the code required
for processing program options and configuration settings.  Processing
options requires a minimum of four different constructs be kept in
proper order in different places in your program.  You need at least:

  1. The flag character in the flag string,

  2. code to process the flag when it is encountered,

  3. a global state variable or two, and

  4. a line in the usage text.

You will need more things besides this if you choose to implement long
option names, configuration (rc/ini) file processing, environment
variable settings and keep all the documentation for these up to date.
This can be done mechanically; with the proper templates and this
program.  In fact, it has already been done and AutoGen itself uses it
*Note AutoOpts::.  For a simple example of Automated Option processing,
*Note Quick Start::.  For a full list of the Automated Option features,
*Note Features::.  Be forewarned, though, the feature list is
ridiculously extensive.

1.1 The Purpose of AutoGen
==========================

The idea of this program is to have a text file, a template if you
will, that contains the general text of the desired output file.  That
file includes substitution expressions and sections of text that are
replicated under the control of separate definition files.

   AutoGen was designed with the following features:

  1. The definitions are completely separate from the template.  By
     completely isolating the definitions from the template it greatly
     increases the flexibility of the template implementation.  A
     secondary goal is that a template user only needs to specify those
     data that are necessary to describe his application of a template.

  2. Each datum in the definitions is named.  Thus, the definitions can
     be rearranged, augmented and become obsolete without it being
     necessary to go back and clean up older definition files.  Reduce
     incompatibilities!

  3. Every definition name defines an array of values, even when there
     is only one entry.  These arrays of values are used to control the
     replication of sections of the template.

  4. There are named collections of definitions.  They form a nested
     hierarchy.  Associated values are collected and associated with a
     group name.  These associated data are used collectively in sets
     of substitutions.

  5. The template has special markers to indicate where substitutions
     are required, much like the `${VAR}' construct in a shell `here
     doc'.  These markers are not fixed strings.  They are specified at
     the start of each template.  Template designers know best what
     fits into their syntax and can avoid marker conflicts.

     We did this because it is burdensome and difficult to avoid
     conflicts using either M4 tokenization or C preprocessor
     substitution rules.  It also makes it easier to specify
     expressions that transform the value.  Of course, our expressions
     are less cryptic than the shell methods.

  6. These same markers are used, in conjunction with enclosed
     keywords, to indicate sections of text that are to be skipped and
     for sections of text that are to be repeated.  This is a major
     improvement over using C preprocessing macros.  With the C
     preprocessor, you have no way of selecting output text because it
     is an unvarying, mechanical substitution process.

  7. Finally, we supply methods for carefully controlling the output.
     Sometimes, it is just simply easier and clearer to compute some
     text or a value in one context when its application needs to be
     later.  So, functions are available for saving text or values for
     later use.

1.2 A Simple Example
====================

This is just one simple example that shows a few basic features.  If
you are interested, you also may run "make check" with the `VERBOSE'
environment variable set and see a number of other examples in the
`agen5/test' directory.

   Assume you have an enumeration of names and you wish to associate
some string with each name.  Assume also, for the sake of this example,
that it is either too complex or too large to maintain easily by hand.
We will start by writing an abbreviated version of what the result is
supposed to be.  We will use that to construct our output templates.

In a header file, `list.h', you define the enumeration and the global
array containing the associated strings:

     typedef enum {
             IDX_ALPHA,
             IDX_BETA,
             IDX_OMEGA }  list_enum;

     extern char const* az_name_list[ 3 ];

Then you also have `list.c' that defines the actual strings:

     #include "list.h"
     char const* az_name_list[] = {
             "some alpha stuff",
             "more beta stuff",
             "final omega stuff" };

First, we will define the information that is unique for each
enumeration name/string pair.  This would be placed in a file named,
`list.def', for example.

     autogen definitions list;
     list = { list_element = alpha;
              list_info    = "some alpha stuff"; };
     list = { list_info    = "more beta stuff";
              list_element = beta; };
     list = { list_element = omega;
              list_info    = "final omega stuff"; };

   The `autogen definitions list;' entry defines the file as an AutoGen
definition file that uses a template named `list'.  That is followed by
three `list' entries that define the associations between the
enumeration names and the strings.  The order of the differently named
elements inside of list is unimportant.  They are reversed inside of the
`beta' entry and the output is unaffected.

   Now, to actually create the output, we need a template or two that
can be expanded into the files you want.  In this program, we use a
single template that is capable of multiple output files.  The
definitions above refer to a `list' template, so it would normally be
named, `list.tpl'.

   It looks something like this.  (For a full description, *Note
Template File::.)

     [+ AutoGen5 template h c +]
     [+ CASE (suffix) +][+
        ==  h  +]
     typedef enum {[+
        FOR list "," +]
             IDX_[+ (string-upcase! (get "list_element")) +][+
        ENDFOR list +] }  list_enum;

     extern char const* az_name_list[ [+ (count "list") +] ];
     [+

        ==  c  +]
     #include "list.h"
     char const* az_name_list[] = {[+
       FOR list "," +]
             "[+list_info+]"[+
       ENDFOR list +] };[+

     ESAC +]

   The `[+ AutoGen5 template h c +]' text tells AutoGen that this is an
AutoGen version 5 template file; that it is to be processed twice; that
the start macro marker is `[+'; and the end marker is `+]'.  The
template will be processed first with a suffix value of `h' and then
with `c'.  Normally, the suffix values are appended to the `base-name'
to create the output file name.

   The `[+ == h +]' and `[+ == c +]' `CASE' selection clauses select
different text for the two different passes.  In this example, the
output is nearly disjoint and could have been put in two separate
templates.  However, sometimes there are common sections and this is
just an example.

   The `[+FOR list "," +]' and `[+ ENDFOR list +]' clauses delimit a
block of text that will be repeated for every definition of `list'.
Inside of that block, the definition name-value pairs that are members
of each `list' are available for substitutions.

   The remainder of the macros are expressions.  Some of these contain
special expression functions that are dependent on AutoGen named values;
others are simply Scheme expressions, the result of which will be
inserted into the output text.  Other expressions are names of AutoGen
values.  These values will be inserted into the output text.  For
example, `[+list_info+]' will result in the value associated with the
name `list_info' being inserted between the double quotes and
`(string-upcase! (get "list_element"))' will first "get" the value
associated with the name `list_element', then change the case of all
the letters to upper case.  The result will be inserted into the output
document.

   If you have compiled AutoGen, you can copy out the template and
definitions as described above and run `autogen list.def'.  This will
produce exactly the hypothesized desired output.

   One more point, too.  Lets say you decided it was too much trouble
to figure out how to use AutoGen, so you created this enumeration and
string list with thousands of entries.  Now, requirements have changed
and it has become necessary to map a string containing the enumeration
name into the enumeration number.  With AutoGen, you just alter the
template to emit the table of names.  It will be guaranteed to be in
the correct order, missing none of the entries.  If you want to do that
by hand, well, good luck.

1.3 csh/zsh caveat
==================

AutoGen tries to use your normal shell so that you can supply shell code
in a manner you are accustomed to using.  If, however, you use csh or
zsh, you cannot do this.  Csh is sufficiently difficult to program that
it is unsupported.  Zsh, though largely programmable, also has some
anomalies that make it incompatible with AutoGen usage.  Therefore, when
invoking AutoGen from these environments, you must be certain to set the
SHELL environment variable to a Bourne-derived shell, e.g., sh, ksh or
bash.

   Any shell you choose for your own scripts need to follow these basic
requirements:

  1. It handles `trap ":" $sig' without output to standard out.  This
     is done when the server shell is first started.  If your shell
     does not handle this, then it may be able to by loading functions
     from its start up files.

  2. At the beginning of each scriptlet, the command `\\cd $PWD' is
     inserted.  This ensures that `cd' is not aliased to something
     peculiar and each scriptlet starts life in the execution directory.

  3. At the end of each scriptlet, the command `echo mumble' is
     appended.  The program you use as a shell must emit the single
     argument `mumble' on a line by itself.

1.4 A User's Perspective
========================

   I am using AutoGen in my pet project, and find one of its best
points to be that it separates the operational data from the
implementation.

   Indulge me for a few paragraphs, and all will be revealed: In the
manual, Bruce cites the example of maintaining command line flags
inside the source code; traditionally spreading usage information, flag
names, letters and processing across several functions (if not files).
Investing the time in writing a sort of boiler plate (a template in
AutoGen terminology) pays by moving all of the option details (usage,
flags names etc.) into a well structured table (a definition file if you
will),  so that adding a new command line option becomes a simple matter
of adding a set of details to the table.

   So far so good!  Of course, now that there is a template, writing
all of that tedious optargs processing and usage functions is no longer
an issue.  Creating a table of the options needed for the new project
and running AutoGen generates all of the option processing code in C
automatically from just the tabular data.  AutoGen in fact already ships
with such a template... AutoOpts.

   One final consequence of the good separation in the design of
AutoGen is that it is retargetable to a greater extent.  The
egcs/gcc/fixinc/inclhack.def can equally be used (with different
templates) to create a shell script (inclhack.sh) or a c program
(fixincl.c).

   This is just the tip of the iceberg.  AutoGen is far more powerful
than these examples might indicate, and has many other varied uses.  I
am certain Bruce or I could supply you with many and varied examples,
and I would heartily recommend that you try it for your project and see
for yourself how it compares to m4.  

   As an aside, I would be interested to see whether someone might be
persuaded to rationalise autoconf with AutoGen in place of m4...  Ben,
are you listening?  autoconf-3.0! `kay?  =)O|

Sincerely,

2 Definitions File
******************

This chapter describes the syntax and semantics of the AutoGen
definition file.  In order to instantiate a template, you normally must
provide a definitions file that identifies itself and contains some
value definitions.  Consequently, we keep it very simple.  For
"advanced" users, there are preprocessing directives, sparse arrays,
named indexes and comments that may be used as well.

   The definitions file is used to associate values with names.  Every
value is implicitly an array of values, even if there is only one value.
Values may be either simple strings or compound collections of
name-value pairs.  An array may not contain both simple and compound
members.  Fundamentally, it is as simple as:

     prog-name = "autogen";
     flag = {
         name      = templ_dirs;
         value     = L;
         descrip   = "Template search directory list";
     };

   For purposes of commenting and controlling the processing of the
definitions, C-style comments and most C preprocessing directives are
honored.  The major exception is that the `#if' directive is ignored,
along with all following text through the matching `#endif' directive.
The C preprocessor is not actually invoked, so C macro substitution is
*not* performed.

2.1 The Identification Definition
=================================

The first definition in this file is used to identify it as a AutoGen
file.  It consists of the two keywords, `autogen' and `definitions'
followed by the default template name and a terminating semi-colon
(`;').  That is:

             AutoGen Definitions TEMPLATE-NAME;

Note that, other than the name TEMPLATE-NAME, the words `AutoGen' and
`Definitions' are searched for without case sensitivity.  Most lookups
in this program are case insensitive.

Also, if the input contains more identification definitions, they will
be ignored.  This is done so that you may include (*note Directives::)
other definition files without an identification conflict.

AutoGen uses the name of the template to find the corresponding template
file.  It searches for the file in the following way, stopping when it
finds the file:

  1. It tries to open `./TEMPLATE-NAME'.  If it fails,

  2. it tries `./TEMPLATE-NAME.tpl'.

  3. It searches for either of these files in the directories listed in
     the templ-dirs command line option.

   If AutoGen fails to find the template file in one of these places,
it prints an error message and exits.

2.2 Named Definitions
=====================

A name is a sequence of characters beginning with an alphabetic
character (`a' through `z') followed by zero or more alpha-numeric
characters and/or separator characters: hyphen (`-'), underscore (`_')
or carat (`^').  Names are case insensitive.

   Any name may have multiple values associated with it.  Every name
may be considered a sparse array of one or more elements.  If there is
more than one value, the values my be accessed by indexing the value
with `[index]' or by iterating over them using the FOR (*note FOR::)
AutoGen macro on it, as described in the next chapter.  Sparse arrays
are specified by specifying an index when defining an entry (*note
Assigning an Index to a Definition: Index Assignments.).

   There are two kinds of definitions, `simple' and `compound'.  They
are defined thus (*note Full Syntax::):

     compound_name '=' '{' definition-list '}' ';'

     simple-name[2] '=' string ';'

     no^text^name ';'

`simple-name' has the third index (index number 2) defined here.
`No^text^name' is a simple definition with a shorthand empty string
value.  The string values for definitions may be specified in any of
several formation rules.

2.2.1 Definition List
---------------------

`definition-list' is a list of definitions that may or may not contain
nested compound definitions.  Any such definitions may *only* be
expanded within a `FOR' block iterating over the containing compound
definition.  *Note FOR::.

   Here is, again, the example definitions from the previous chapter,
with three additional name value pairs.  Two with an empty value
assigned (FIRST and LAST), and a "global" GROUP_NAME.

     autogen definitions list;
     group_name = example;
     list = { list_element = alpha;  first;
              list_info    = "some alpha stuff"; };
     list = { list_info    = "more beta stuff";
              list_element = beta; };
     list = { list_element = omega;  last;
              list_info    = "final omega stuff"; };

2.2.2 Double Quote String
-------------------------

The string follows the C-style escaping, using the backslash to quote
(escape) the following character(s).  Certain letters are translated to
various control codes (e.g. `\n', `\f', `\t', etc.).  `x' introduces a
two character hex code.  `0' (the digit zero) introduces a one to three
character octal code (note: an octal byte followed by a digit must be
represented with three octal digits, thus: `"\0001"' yielding a NUL
byte followed by the ASCII digit 1).  Any other character following the
backslash escape is simply inserted, without error, into the string
being formed.

   Like ANSI "C", a series of these strings, possibly intermixed with
single quote strings, will be concatenated together.

2.2.3 Single Quote String
-------------------------

This is similar to the shell single-quote string.  However, escapes `\'
are honored before another escape, single quotes `'' and hash
characters `#'.  This latter is done specifically to disambiguate lines
starting with a hash character inside of a quoted string.  In other
words,

     fumble = '
     #endif
     ';

   could be misinterpreted by the definitions scanner, whereas this
would not:

     fumble = '
     \#endif
     ';

As with the double quote string, a series of these, even intermixed
with double quote strings, will be concatenated together.

2.2.4 An Unquoted String
------------------------

A simple string that does not contain white space may be left unquoted.
The string must not contain any of the characters special to the
definition text (i.e., `"', `#', `'', `(', `)', `,', `;', `<', `=',
`>', `[', `]', ``', `{', or `}').  This list is subject to change, but
it will never contain underscore (`_'), period (`.'), slash (`/'),
colon (`:'), hyphen (`-') or backslash (`\\').  Basically, if the
string looks like it is a normal DOS or UNIX file or variable name, and
it is not one of two keywords (`autogen' or `definitions') then it is
OK to not quote it, otherwise you should.

2.2.5 Shell Output String
-------------------------

This is assembled according to the same rules as the double quote
string, except that there is no concatenation of strings and the
resulting string is written to a shell server process.  The definition
takes on the value of the output string.

   NB The text is interpreted by a server shell.  There may be left over
state from previous server shell processing.  This scriptlet may also
leave state for subsequent processing.  However, a `cd' to the original
directory is always issued before the new command is issued.

2.2.6 Scheme Result String
--------------------------

A scheme result string must begin with an open parenthesis `('.  The
scheme expression will be evaluated by Guile and the value will be the
result.  The AutoGen expression functions are *dis*abled at this stage,
so do not use them.

2.2.7 A Here String
-------------------

A `here string' is formed in much the same way as a shell here doc.  It
is denoted with two less than characters(`<<') and, optionally, a
hyphen.  This is followed by optional horizontal white space and an
ending marker-identifier.  This marker must follow the syntax rules for
identifiers.  Unlike the shell version, however, you must not quote
this marker.

   The resulting string will start with the first character on the next
line and continue up to but not including the newline that precedes the
line that begins with the marker token.  The characters are copied
directly into the result string.  Mostly.

   If a hyphen follows the less than characters, then leading tabs will
be stripped and the terminating marker will be recognized even if
preceded by tabs.  Also, if the first character on the line (after
removing tabs) is a backslash and the next character is a tab or space,
then the backslash will be removed as well.  No other kind of
processing is done on this string.

   Here are three examples:
     str1 = <<-  STR_END
             $quotes = " ' `
             STR_END;

     str2 = <<   STR_END
             $quotes = " ' `
             STR_END;
     STR_END;

     str3 = <<-  STR_END
             \	$quotes = " ' `
             STR_END;
   The first string contains no new line characters.  The first
character is the dollar sign, the last the back quote.

   The second string contains one new line character.  The first
character is the tab character preceding the dollar sign.  The last
character is the semicolon after the `STR_END'.  That `STR_END' does not
end the string because it is not at the beginning of the line.  In the
preceding case, the leading tab was stripped.

   The third string is almost identical to the first, except that the
first character is a tab.  That is, it exactly matches the first line
of the second string.

2.2.8 Concatenated Strings
--------------------------

If single or double quote characters are used, then you also have the
option, a la ANSI-C syntax, of implicitly concatenating a series of
them together, with intervening white space ignored.

   NB  You *cannot* use directives to alter the string content.  That
is,

     str = "fumble"
     #ifdef LATER
           "stumble"
     #endif
           ;

will result in a syntax error.  The preprocessing directives are not
carried out by the C preprocessor.  However,

     str = '"fumble\n"
     #ifdef LATER
     "     stumble\n"
     #endif
     ';

*Will* work.  It will enclose the `#ifdef LATER' and `#endif' in the
string.  But it may also wreak havoc with the definition processing
directives.  The hash characters in the first column should be
disambiguated with an escape `\' or join them with previous lines:
`"fumble\n#ifdef LATER...'.

2.3 Assigning an Index to a Definition
======================================

In AutoGen, every name is implicitly an array of values.  When
assigning values, they are usually implicitly assigned to the next
highest slot.  They can also be specified explicitly:

     mumble[9] = stumble;
     mumble[0] = grumble;

If, subsequently, you assign a value to `mumble' without an index, its
index will be `10', not `1'.  If indexes are specified, they must not
cause conflicts.

   `#define'-d names may also be used for index values.  This is
equivalent to the above:

     #define FIRST 0
     #define LAST  9
     mumble[LAST]  = stumble;
     mumble[FIRST] = grumble;

   All values in a range do *not* have to be filled in.  If you leave
gaps, then you will have a sparse array.  This is fine (*note FOR::).
You have your choice of iterating over all the defined values, or
iterating over a range of slots.  This:

     [+ FOR mumble +][+ ENDFOR +]

iterates over all and only the defined entries, whereas this:

     [+ FOR mumble (for-by 1) +][+ ENDFOR +]

will iterate over all 10 "slots".  Your template will likely have to
contain something like this:

     [+ IF (exist? (sprintf "mumble[%d]" (for-index))) +]

or else "mumble" will have to be a compound value that, say, always
contains a "grumble" value:

     [+ IF (exist? "grumble") +]

2.4 Dynamic Text
================

There are several methods for including dynamic content inside a
definitions file.  Three of them are mentioned above (*note
shell-generated:: and *note scheme-generated::) in the discussion of
string formation rules.  Another method uses the `#shell' processing
directive.  It will be discussed in the next section (*note
Directives::).  Guile/Scheme may also be used to yield to create
definitions.

   When the Scheme expression is preceded by a backslash and single
quote, then the expression is expected to be an alist of names and
values that will be used to create AutoGen definitions.

This method can be be used as follows:

     \'( (name  (value-expression))
         (name2 (another-expr))  )

This is entirely equivalent to:

     name  = (value-expression);
     name2 = (another-expr);

Under the covers, the expression gets handed off to a Guile function
named `alist->autogen-def' in an expression that looks like this:

     (alist->autogen-def
         ( (name (value-expression))  (name2 (another-expr)) ) )

2.5 Controlling What Gets Processed
===================================

Definition processing directives can *only* be processed if the '#'
character is the first character on a line.  Also, if you want a '#' as
the first character of a line in one of your string assignments, you
should either escape it by preceding it with a backslash `\', or by
embedding it in the string as in `"\n#"'.

   All of the normal C preprocessing directives are recognized, though
several are ignored.  There is also an additional `#shell' -
`#endshell' pair.  Another minor difference is that AutoGen directives
must have the hash character (`#') in column 1.  Unrecognized
directives produce an error.

   The final tweak is that `#!' is treated as a comment line.  Using
this feature, you can use:  `#! /usr/local/bin/autogen' as the first
line of a definitions file, set the mode to executable and "run" the
definitions file as if it were a direct invocation of AutoGen.  This
was done for its hack value.

   The AutoGen recognized directives are:
`#assert'
     This directive is processed, but only if the expression begins with
     either a back quote (``') or an open parenthesis (`(').  Text
     within the back quotes are handed off to the shell for processing
     and parenthesized text is handed off to Guile.  Multiple line
     expressions must be joined with backslashes.

     If the `shell-script' or `scheme-expr' do not yield `true' valued
     results, autogen will be aborted.  If `<anything else>' or nothing
     at all is provided, then this directive is ignored.

     The result is `false' (and fails) if the result is empty, the
     number zero, or a string that starts with the letters 'n' or 'f'
     ("no" or "false").

`#define'
     Will add the name to the define list as if it were a DEFINE program
     argument.  Its value will be the first non-whitespace token
     following the name.  Quotes are *not* processed.

     After the definitions file has been processed, any remaining
     entries in the define list will be added to the environment.

`#elif'
     Marks a transition in the #if directive.  Error when out of
     context.  #if blocks are always ignored.

`#else'
     This must follow an `#if', `#ifdef' or `#ifndef'.  If it follows
     the `#if', then it will be ignored.  Otherwise, it will change the
     processing state to the reverse of what it was.

`#endif'
     This must follow an `#if', `#ifdef' or `#ifndef'.  In all cases,
     this will resume normal processing of text.

`#endmac'
     Marks the end of the #macdef directive.  Error when out of context.

`#endshell'
     Marks the end of the #shell directive.  Error when out of context.

`#error'
     This directive will cause AutoGen to stop processing and exit with
     a status of EXIT_FAILURE.

`#ident'
     Ignored directive.

`#if'
     `#if' expressions are not analyzed.  *Everything* from here to the
     matching `#endif' is skipped.

`#ifdef'
     The definitions that follow, up to the matching `#endif' will be
     processed only if there is a corresponding `-Dname' command line
     option or if a `#define' of that name has been previously
     encountered.

`#ifndef'
     The definitions that follow, up to the matching `#endif' will be
     processed only if the named value has *not* been defined.

`#include'
     This directive will insert definitions from another file into the
     current collection.  If the file name is adorned with double
     quotes or angle brackets (as in a C program), then the include is
     ignored.

`#let'
     Ignored directive.

`#line'
     Alters the current line number and/or file name.  You may wish to
     use this directive if you extract definition source from other
     files.  `getdefs' uses this mechanism so AutoGen will report the
     correct file and approximate line number of any errors found in
     extracted definitions.

`#macdef'
     This is a new AT&T research preprocessing directive.  Basically,
     it is a multi-line #define that may include other preprocessing
     directives.  Text between this line and a #endmac directive are
     ignored.

`#option'
     This directive will pass the option name and associated text to the
     AutoOpts optionLoadLine routine (*note libopts-optionLoadLine::).
     The option text may span multiple lines by continuing them with a
     backslash.  The backslash/newline pair will be replaced with two
     space characters.  This directive may be used to set a search path
     for locating template files For example, this:

          #option templ-dirs $ENVVAR/dirname
     will direct autogen to use the `ENVVAR' environment variable to
     find a directory named `dirname' that (may) contain templates.
     Since these directories are searched in most recently supplied
     first order, search directories supplied in this way will be
     searched before any supplied on the command line.

`#pragma'
     Ignored directive.

`#shell'
     Invokes `$SHELL' or `/bin/sh' on a script that should generate
     AutoGen definitions.  It does this using the same server process
     that handles the back-quoted ``' text.  The block of text handed
     to the shell is terminated with the #endshell directive.

     *CAUTION*  let not your `$SHELL' be `csh'.

`#undef'
     Will remove any entries from the define list that match the undef
     name pattern.

2.6 Pre-defined Names
=====================

When AutoGen starts, it tries to determine several names from the
operating environment and put them into environment variables for use in
both `#ifdef' tests in the definitions files and in shell scripts with
environment variable tests.  `__autogen__' is always defined.  For
other names, AutoGen will first try to use the POSIX version of the
`sysinfo(2)' system call.  Failing that, it will try for the POSIX
`uname(2)' call.  If neither is available, then only "`__autogen__'"
will be inserted into the environment.  In all cases, the associated
names are converted to lower case, surrounded by doubled underscores
and non-symbol characters are replaced with underscores.

   With Solaris on a sparc platform, `sysinfo(2)' is available.  The
following strings are used:

   * `SI_SYSNAME' (e.g., "__sunos__")

   * `SI_HOSTNAME' (e.g., "__ellen__")

   * `SI_ARCHITECTURE' (e.g., "__sparc__")

   * `SI_HW_PROVIDER' (e.g., "__sun_microsystems__")

   * `SI_PLATFORM' (e.g., "__sun_ultra_5_10__")

   * `SI_MACHINE' (e.g., "__sun4u__")

   For Linux and other operating systems that only support the
`uname(2)' call, AutoGen will use these values:

   * `sysname' (e.g., "__linux__")

   * `machine' (e.g., "__i586__")

   * `nodename' (e.g., "__bach__")

   By testing these pre-defines in my definitions, you can select
pieces of the definitions without resorting to writing shell scripts
that parse the output of `uname(1)'.  You can also segregate real C
code from autogen definitions by testing for "`__autogen__'".

     #ifdef __bach__
       location = home;
     #else
       location = work;
     #endif

2.7 Commenting Your Definitions
===============================

The definitions file may contain C and C++ style comments.

     /*
      *  This is a comment.  It continues for several lines and closes
      *  when the characters '*' and '/' appear together.
      */
     // this comment is a single line comment

2.8 What it all looks like.
===========================

This is an extended example:

     autogen definitions `template-name';
     /*
      *  This is a comment that describes what these
      *  definitions are all about.
      */
     global = "value for a global text definition.";

     /*
      *  Include a standard set of definitions
      */
     #include standards.def

     a_block = {
         a_field;
         a_subblock = {
             sub_name  = first;
             sub_field = "sub value.";
         };

     #ifdef FEATURE
         a_subblock = {
             sub_name  = second;
         };
     #endif

     };

2.9 Finite State Machine Grammar
================================

The preprocessing directives and comments are not part of the grammar.
They are handled by the scanner/lexer.  The following was extracted
directly from the generated defParse-fsm.c source file.  The "EVT:" is
the token seen, the "STATE:" is the current state and the entries in
this table describe the next state and the action to take.  Invalid
transitions were removed from the table.

     dp_trans_table[ DP_STATE_CT ][ DP_EVENT_CT ] = {

       /* STATE 0:  DP_ST_INIT */
       { { DP_ST_NEED_DEF, NULL },                       /* EVT:  AUTOGEN */

         { DP_ST_INVALID, dp_do_invalid }                /* EVT:  ] */

2.10 Alternate Definition Forms
===============================

There are several methods for supplying data values for templates.

`no definitions'
     It is entirely possible to write a template that does not depend
     upon external definitions.  Such a template would likely have an
     unvarying output, but be convenient nonetheless because of an
     external library of either AutoGen or Scheme functions, or both.
     This can be accommodated by providing the `--override-tpl' and
     `--no-definitions' options on the command line.  *Note autogen
     Invocation::.

`CGI'
     AutoGen behaves as a CGI server if the definitions input is from
     stdin and the environment variable `REQUEST_METHOD' is defined and
     set to either "GET" or "POST", *Note AutoGen CGI::.  Obviously,
     all the values are constrained to strings because there is no way
     to represent nested values.

`XML'
     AutoGen comes with a program named, `xml2ag'.  Its output can
     either be redirected to a file for later use, or the program can
     be used as an AutoGen wrapper.  *Note xml2ag Invocation::.

     The introductory template example (*note Example Usage::) can be
     rewritten in XML as follows:

          <EXAMPLE  template="list.tpl">
          <LIST list_element="alpha"
                list_info="some alpha stuff"/>
          <LIST list_info="more beta stuff"
                list_element="beta"/>
          <LIST list_element="omega"
                list_info="final omega stuff"/>
          </EXAMPLE>

     A more XML-normal form might look like this:
          <EXAMPLE  template="list.tpl">
          <LIST list_element="alpha">some alpha stuff</LIST>
          <LIST list_element="beta" >more beta stuff</LIST>
          <LIST list_element="omega">final omega stuff</LIST>
          </EXAMPLE>
     but you would have to change the template `list-info' references
     into `text' references.

`standard AutoGen definitions'
     Of course.  :-)


3 Template File
***************

The AutoGen template file defines the content of the output text.  It
is composed of two parts.  The first part consists of a pseudo macro
invocation and commentary.  It is followed by the template proper.

   This pseudo macro is special.  It is used to identify the file as a
AutoGen template file, fixing the starting and ending marks for the
macro invocations in the rest of the file, specifying the list of
suffixes to be generated by the template and, optionally, the shell to
use for processing shell commands embedded in the template.

   AutoGen-ing a file consists of copying text from the template to the
output file until a start macro marker is found.  The text from the
start marker to the end marker constitutes the macro text.  AutoGen
macros may cause sections of the template to be skipped or processed
several times.  The process continues until the end of the template is
reached.  The process is repeated once for each suffix specified in the
pseudo macro.

   This chapter describes the format of the AutoGen template macros and
the usage of the AutoGen native macros.  Users may augment these by
defining their own macros, *Note DEFINE::.

3.1 Format of the Pseudo Macro
==============================

The pseudo macro is used to tell AutoGen how to process a template.  It
tells autogen:

  1. The start macro marker.  It consists of punctuation characters
     used to demarcate the start of a macro.  It may be up to seven
     characters long and must be the first non-whitespace characters in
     the file.

     It is generally a good idea to use some sort of opening bracket in
     the starting macro and closing bracket in the ending macro  (e.g.
     `{', `(', `[', or even `<' in the starting macro).  It helps both
     visually and with editors capable of finding a balancing
     parenthesis.

  2. That start marker must be immediately followed by the identifier
     strings "AutoGen5" and then "template", though capitalization is
     not important.

The next several components may be intermingled:

  3. Zero, one or more suffix specifications tell AutoGen how many
     times to process the template file.  No suffix specifications mean
     that it is to be processed once and that the generated text is to
     be written to `stdout'.  The current suffix for each pass can be
     determined with the `(suffix)' scheme function (*note SCM
     suffix::).

     The suffix specification consists of a sequence of POSIX compliant
     file name characters and, optionally, an equal sign and a file
     name formatting specification.  That specification may be either
     an ordinary sequence of file name characters with zero, one or two
     "%s" formatting sequences in it, or else it may be a Scheme
     expression that, when evaluated, produces such a string.  The
     Scheme result may not be empty.  The two string arguments allowed
     for that string are the base name of the definition file, and the
     current suffix (that being the text to the left of the equal
     sign).  (Note: "POSIX compliant file name characters" consist of
     alphanumerics plus the period (`.'), hyphen (`-') and underscore
     (`_') characters.)

     If the suffix begins with one of these three latter characters and
     a formatting string is not specified, then that character is
     presumed to be the suffix separator.  Otherwise, without a
     specified format string, a single period will separate the suffix
     from the base name in constructing the output file name.

  4. Shell specification: to specify that the template was written
     expecting a particular shell to run the shell commands.  By
     default, the shell used is the autoconf-ed `CONFIG_SHELL'.  This
     will usually be `/bin/sh'.  The shell is specified by a hash mark
     (`#') followed by an exclamation mark (`!') followed by a
     full-path file name (e.g. `/usr/xpg4/bin/sh' on Solaris):
          [= Autogen5 Template c
          #!/usr/xpg4/bin/sh
          =]

  5. Comments: blank lines, lines starting with a hash mark (`#') and
     not specifying a shell, and edit mode markers (text between pairs
     of `-*-' strings) are all treated as comments.

  6. Some scheme expressions may be inserted in order to make
     configuration changes before template processing begins.  before
     template processing begins means that there is no current output
     file, no current suffix and, basically, none of the AutoGen
     specific functions (*note AutoGen Functions::) may be invoked.

     The scheme expression can also be used, for example, to save a
     pre-existing output file for later text extraction (*note SCM
     extract::).

          (shellf "mv -f %1$s.c %1$s.sav" (base-name))

After these must come the end macro marker:

  6. The punctuation characters used to demarcate the end of a macro.
     Like the start marker, it must consist of seven or fewer
     punctuation characters.

   The ending macro marker has a few constraints on its content.  Some
of them are just advisory, though.  There is no special check for
advisory restrictions.

   * It must not begin with a POSIX file name character (hyphen `-',
     underscore `_' or period `.'), the backslash (`\') or open
     parenthesis (`(').  These are used to identify a suffix
     specification, indicate Scheme code and trim white space.

   * If it begins with an equal sign, then it must be separated from
     any suffix specification by white space.

   * The closing marker may not begin with an open parenthesis, as that
     is used to enclose a scheme expression.

   * It cannot begin with a backslash, as that is used to indicate white
     space trimming after the end macro mark.  If, in the body of the
     template, you put the backslash character (`\') before the end
     macro mark, then any white space characters after the mark and
     through the newline character are trimmed.

   * It is also helpful to avoid using the comment marker (`#').  It
     might be seen as a comment within the pseudo macro.

   * You should avoid using any of the quote characters  double, single
     or back-quote.  It won't confuse AutoGen, but it might well
     confuse you and/or your editor.

   As an example, assume we want to use `[+' and `+]' as the start and
end macro markers, and we wish to produce a `.c' and a `.h' file, then
the pseudo macro might look something like this:

     [+ AutoGen5 template -*- Mode: emacs-mode-of-choice -*-
     h=chk-%s.h
     c
     # make sure we don't use csh:
     (setenv "SHELL" "/bin/sh")  +]

   The template proper starts after the pseudo-macro.  The starting
character is either the first non-whitespace character or the first
character after the newline that follows the end macro marker.

3.2 Naming a value
==================

When an AutoGen value is specified in a template, it is specified by
name.  The name may be a simple name, or a compound name of several
components.  Since each named value in AutoGen is implicitly an array
of one or more values, each component may have an index associated with
it.

It looks like this:

     comp-name-1 . comp-name-2 [ 2 ]

   Note that if there are multiple components to a name, each component
name is separated by a dot (`.').  Indexes follow a component name,
enclosed in square brackets (`[' and `]').  The index may be either an
integer or an integer-valued define name.  The first component of the
name is searched for in the current definition level.  If not found,
higher levels will be searched until either a value is found, or there
are no more definition levels.  Subsequent components of the name must
be found within the context of the newly-current definition level.
Also, if the named value is prefixed by a dot (`.'), then the value
search is started in the current context only.  Backtracking into other
definition levels is prevented.

   If someone rewrites this, I'll incorporate it.  :-)

3.3 Macro Expression Syntax
===========================

AutoGen has two types of expressions:  full expressions and basic ones.
A full AutoGen expression can appear by itself, or as the argument to
certain AutoGen built-in macros:  CASE, IF, ELIF, INCLUDE, INVOKE
(explicit invocation, *note INVOKE::), and WHILE.  If it appears by
itself, the result is inserted into the output.  If it is an argument
to one of these macros, the macro code will act on it sensibly.

   You are constrained to basic expressions only when passing arguments
to user defined macros, *Note DEFINE::.

   The syntax of a full AutoGen expression is:

     [[ <apply-code> ] <value-name> ] [ <basic-expr-1> [ <basic-expr-2> ]]

   How the expression is evaluated depends upon the presence or absence
of the apply code and value name.  The "value name" is the name of an
AutoGen defined value, or not.  If it does not name such a value, the
expression result is generally the empty string.  All expressions must
contain either a VALUE-NAME or a BASIC-EXPR.

3.3.1 Apply Code
----------------

The "apply code" selected determines the method of evaluating the
expression.  There are five apply codes, including the non-use of an
apply code.

`no apply code'
     This is the most common expression type.  Expressions of this sort
     come in three flavors:

    `<value-name>'
          The result is the value of VALUE-NAME, if defined.  Otherwise
          it is the empty string.

    `<basic-expr>'
          The result of the basic expression is the result of the full
          expression, *Note basic expression::.

    `<value-name> <basic-expr>'
          If there is a defined value for VALUE-NAME, then the
          BASIC-EXPR is evaluated.  Otherwise, the result is the empty
          string.

`% <value-name> <basic-expr>'
     If VALUE-NAME is defined, use BASIC-EXPR as a format string for
     sprintf.  Then, if the BASIC-EXPR is either a back-quoted string
     or a parenthesized expression, then hand the result to the
     appropriate interpreter for further evaluation.  Otherwise, for
     single and double quote strings, the result is the result of the
     sprintf operation.  Naturally, if VALUE-NAME is not defined, the
     result is the empty string.

     For example, assume that `fumble' had the string value, `stumble':
          [+ % fumble `printf '%%x\\n' $%s` +]
     This would cause the shell to evaluate "`printf '%x\n' $stumble'".
     Assuming that the shell variable `stumble' had a numeric value,
     the expression result would be that number, in hex.  Note the need
     for doubled percent characters and backslashes.

`? <value-name> <basic-expr-1> <basic-expr-2>'
     Two BASIC-EXPR-s are required.  If the VALUE-NAME is defined, then
     the first BASIC-EXPR-1 is evaluated, otherwise BASIC-EXPR-2 is.

`- <value-name> <basic-expr>'
     Evaluate BASIC-EXPR only if VALUE-NAME is not defined.

`?% <value-name> <basic-expr-1> <basic-expr-2>'
     This combines the functions of `?' and `%'.  If VALUE-NAME is
     defined, it behaves exactly like `%', above, using BASIC-EXPR-1.
     If not defined, then BASIC-EXPR-2 is evaluated.

     For example, assume again that `fumble' had the string value,
     `stumble':
          [+ ?% fumble `cat $%s` `pwd` +]
     This would cause the shell to evaluate "`cat $stumble'".  If
     `fumble' were not defined, then the result would be the name of
     our current directory.

3.3.2 Basic Expression
----------------------

A basic expression can have one of the following forms:

`'STRING''
     A single quoted string.  Backslashes can be used to protect single
     quotes (`''), hash characters (`#'), or backslashes (`\') in the
     string.  All other characters of STRING are output as-is when the
     single quoted string is evaluated.  Backslashes are processed
     before the hash character for consistency with the definition
     syntax.  It is needed there to avoid preprocessing conflicts.

`"STRING"'
     A double quoted string.  This is a cooked text string as in C,
     except that they are not concatenated with adjacent strings.
     Evaluating "`STRING'" will output STRING with all backslash
     sequences interpreted.

``STRING`'
     A back quoted string.  When this expression is evaluated, STRING
     is first interpreted as a cooked string (as in `"STRING"') and
     evaluated as a shell expression by the AutoGen server shell.  This
     expression is replaced by the `stdout' output of the shell.

`(STRING)'
     A parenthesized expression.  It will be passed to the Guile
     interpreter for evaluation and replaced by the resulting value.
     If there is a Scheme error in this expression, Guile 1.4 and Guile
     1.6 will report the template line number where the error occurs.
     Guile 1.7 has lost this capability.

     Guile has the capability of creating and manipulating variables
     that can be referenced later on in the template processing.  If
     you define such a variable, it is invisible to AutoGen.  To
     reference its value, you must use a Guile expression.  For example,
          [+ (define my-var "some-string-value") +]
     can have that string inserted later, but only as in:
          [+ (. my-var) +]

     Additionally, other than in the `%' and `?%' expressions, the
     Guile expressions may be introduced with the Guile comment
     character (`;') and you may put a series of Guile expressions
     within a single macro.  They will be implicitly evaluated as if
     they were arguments to the `(begin ...)' expression.  The result
     will be the result of the last Guile expression evaluated.

3.4 AutoGen Scheme Functions
============================

AutoGen uses Guile to interpret Scheme expressions within AutoGen
macros.  All of the normal Guile functions are available, plus several
extensions (*note Common Functions::) have been added to augment the
repertoire of string manipulation functions and manage the state of
AutoGen processing.

   This section describes those functions that are specific to AutoGen.
Please take note that these AutoGen specific functions are not loaded
and thus not made available until after the command line options have
been processed and the AutoGen definitions have been loaded.  They may,
of course, be used in Scheme functions that get defined at those times,
but they cannot be invoked.

3.4.1 `ag-fprintf' - format to autogen stream
---------------------------------------------

Usage:  (ag-fprintf ag-diversion format [ format-arg ... ])
Format a string using arguments from the alist.  Write to a specified
AutoGen diversion.  That may be either a specified suspended output
stream (*note SCM out-suspend::) or an index into the output stack
(*note SCM out-push-new::).  `(ag-fprintf 0 ...)' is equivalent to
`(emit (sprintf ...))', and `(ag-fprintf 1 ...)' sends output to the
most recently suspended output stream.

   Arguments:
ag-diversion - AutoGen diversion name or number
format - formatting string
format-arg - Optional - list of arguments to formatting string

3.4.2 `ag-function?' - test for function
----------------------------------------

Usage:  (ag-function? ag-name)
return SCM_BOOL_T if a specified name is a user-defined AutoGen macro,
otherwise return SCM_BOOL_F.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen macro

3.4.3 `base-name' - base output name
------------------------------------

Usage:  (base-name)
Returns a string containing the base name of the output file(s).
Generally, this is also the base name of the definitions file.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.

3.4.4 `chdir' - Change current directory
----------------------------------------

Usage:  (chdir dir)
Sets the current directory for AutoGen.  Shell commands will run from
this directory as well.  This is a wrapper around the Guile native
function.  It returns its directory name argument and fails the program
on failure.

   Arguments:
dir - new directory name

3.4.5 `count' - definition count
--------------------------------

Usage:  (count ag-name)
Count the number of entries for a definition.  The input argument must
be a string containing the name of the AutoGen values to be counted.
If there is no value associated with the name, the result is an SCM
immediate integer value of zero.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value

3.4.6 `def-file' - definitions file name
----------------------------------------

Usage:  (def-file)
Get the name of the definitions file.  Returns the name of the source
file containing the AutoGen definitions.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.

3.4.7 `def-file-line' - get a definition file+line number
---------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (def-file-line ag-name [ msg-fmt ])
Returns the file and line number of a AutoGen defined value, using
either the default format, "from %s line %d", or else the format you
supply.  For example, if you want to insert a "C" language file-line
directive, you would supply the format "# %2$d \"%1$s\"", but that is
also already supplied with the scheme variable *Note SCM
c-file-line-fmt::.  You may use it thus:

     (def-file-line "ag-def-name" c-file-line-fmt)

   It is also safe to use the formatting string, "%2$d".  AutoGen uses
an argument vector version of printf: *Note snprintfv::.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value
msg-fmt - Optional - formatting for line message

3.4.8 `dne' - "Do Not Edit" warning
-----------------------------------

Usage:  (dne prefix [ first_prefix ] [ optpfx ])
Generate a "DO NOT EDIT" or "EDIT WITH CARE" warning string.  Which
depends on whether or not the `--writable' command line option was set.

   The first argument may be an option: `-D' or `-d', causing the
second and (potentially) third arguments to be interpreted as the first
and second arguments.  The only useful option is `-D':

`-D'
     will add date, timestamp and version information.

`-d'
     is ignored, but still accepted for compatibility with older
     versions of the "dne" function where emitting the date was the
     default.

   If one of these options is specified, then the "prefix" and "first"
arguments are obtained from the following arguments.  The presence (or
absence) of this option can be overridden with the environment variable,
`AUTOGEN_DNE_DATE'.  The date is disabled if the value is empty or
starts with one of the characters, `0nNfF' - zero or the first letter
of "no" or "false".

   The `prefix' argument is a per-line string prefix.  The optional
second argument is a prefix for the first line only and, in read-only
mode, activates editor hints.

     -*- buffer-read-only: t -*- vi: set ro:

The warning string also includes information about the template used to
construct the file and the definitions used in its instantiation.

   Arguments:
prefix - string for starting each output line
first_prefix - Optional - for the first output line
optpfx - Optional - shifted prefix

3.4.9 `emit' - emit the text for each argument
----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (emit alist ...)
Walk the tree of arguments, displaying the values of displayable SCM
types.  EXCEPTION: if the first argument is a number, then that number
is used to index the output stack.  "0" is the default, the current
output.

   Arguments:
alist - list of arguments to stringify and emit

3.4.10 `emit-string-table' - output a string table
--------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (emit-string-table st-name)
Emit into the current output stream a `static char const' array named
`st-name' that will have `NUL' bytes between each inserted string.

   Arguments:
st-name - the name of the array of characters

3.4.11 `error' - display message and exit
-----------------------------------------

Usage:  (error message)
The argument is a string that printed out as part of an error message.
The message is formed from the formatting string:

     DEFINITIONS ERROR in %s line %d for %s:  %s\n

   The first three arguments to this format are provided by the routine
and are:  The name of the template file, the line within the template
where the error was found, and the current output file name.

   After displaying the message, the current output file is removed and
autogen exits with the EXIT_FAILURE error code.  IF, however, the
argument begins with the number 0 (zero), or the string is the empty
string, then processing continues with the next suffix.

   Arguments:
message - message to display before exiting

3.4.12 `exist?' - test for value name
-------------------------------------

Usage:  (exist? ag-name)
return SCM_BOOL_T iff a specified name has an AutoGen value.  The name
may include indexes and/or member names.  All but the last member name
must be an aggregate definition.  For example:
     (exist? "foo[3].bar.baz")
   will yield true if all of the following is true:
There is a member value of either group or string type named `baz' for
some group value `bar' that is a member of the `foo' group with index
`3'.  There may be multiple entries of `bar' within `foo', only one
needs to contain a value for `baz'.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value

3.4.13 `find-file' - locate a file in the search path
-----------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (find-file file-name [ suffix ])
AutoGen has a search path that it uses to locate template and definition
files.  This function will search the same list for `file-name', both
with and without the `.suffix', if provided.

   Arguments:
file-name - name of file with text
suffix - Optional - file suffix to try, too

3.4.14 `first-for?' - detect first iteration
--------------------------------------------

Usage:  (first-for? [ for_var ])
Returns `SCM_BOOL_T' if the named FOR loop (or, if not named, the
current innermost loop) is on the first pass through the data.  Outside
of any `FOR' loop, it returns `SCM_UNDEFINED', *note FOR::.

   Arguments:
for_var - Optional - which for loop

3.4.15 `for-by' - set iteration step
------------------------------------

Usage:  (for-by by)
This function records the "step by" information for an AutoGen FOR
function.  Outside of the FOR macro itself, this function will emit an
error.  *Note FOR::.

   Arguments:
by - the iteration increment for the AutoGen FOR macro

3.4.16 `for-from' - set initial index
-------------------------------------

Usage:  (for-from from)
This function records the initial index information for an AutoGen FOR
function.  Outside of the FOR macro itself, this function will emit an
error.  *Note FOR::.

   Arguments:
from - the initial index for the AutoGen FOR macro

3.4.17 `for-index' - get current loop index
-------------------------------------------

Usage:  (for-index [ for_var ])
Returns the current index for the named `FOR' loop.  If not named, then
the index for the innermost loop.  Outside of any FOR loop, it returns
`SCM_UNDEFINED', *Note FOR::.

   Arguments:
for_var - Optional - which for loop

3.4.18 `for-sep' - set loop separation string
---------------------------------------------

Usage:  (for-sep separator)
This function records the separation string that is to be inserted
between each iteration of an AutoGen FOR function.  This is often
nothing more than a comma.  Outside of the FOR macro itself, this
function will emit an error.

   Arguments:
separator - the text to insert between the output of each FOR iteration

3.4.19 `for-to' - set ending index
----------------------------------

Usage:  (for-to to)
This function records the terminating value information for an AutoGen
FOR function.  Outside of the FOR macro itself, this function will emit
an error.  *Note FOR::.

   Arguments:
to - the final index for the AutoGen FOR macro

3.4.20 `found-for?' - is current index in list?
-----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (found-for? [ for_var ])
Returns SCM_BOOL_T if the currently indexed value is present, otherwise
SCM_BOOL_F.  Outside of any FOR loop, it returns SCM_UNDEFINED. *Note
FOR::.

   Arguments:
for_var - Optional - which for loop

3.4.21 `get' - get named value
------------------------------

Usage:  (get ag-name [ alt-val ])
Get the first string value associated with the name.  It will either
return the associated string value (if the name resolves), the
alternate value (if one is provided), or else the empty string.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value
alt-val - Optional - value if not present

3.4.22 `get-c-name' - get named value, mapped to C name syntax
--------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (get-c-name ag-name)
Get the first string value associated with the name.  It will either
return the associated string value (if the name resolves), the alternate
value (if one is provided), or else the empty string.  The result is
passed through "string->c-name!".

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value

3.4.23 `get-down-name' - get lower cased named value, mapped to C name syntax
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (get-down-name ag-name)
Get the first string value associated with the name.  It will either
return the associated string value (if the name resolves), the alternate
value (if one is provided), or else the empty string.  The result is
passed through "string->c-name!" and "string->down-case!".

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value

3.4.24 `get-up-name' - get upper cased named value, mapped to C name syntax
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (get-up-name ag-name)
Get the first string value associated with the name.  It will either
return the associated string value (if the name resolves), the alternate
value (if one is provided), or else the empty string.  The result is
passed through "string->c-name!" and "string->up-case!".

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value

3.4.25 `high-lim' - get highest value index
-------------------------------------------

Usage:  (high-lim ag-name)
Returns the highest index associated with an array of definitions.
This is generally, but not necessarily, one less than the `count'
value.  (The indexes may be specified, rendering a non-zero based or
sparse array of values.)

   This is very useful for specifying the size of a zero-based array of
values where not all values are present.  For example:

     tMyStruct myVals[ [+ (+ 1 (high-lim "my-val-list")) +] ];

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value

3.4.26 `insert-file' - insert the contents of a (list of) files.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (insert-file alist ...)
Insert the contents of one or more files.

   Arguments:
alist - list of files to emit

3.4.27 `insert-suspended' - insert a named suspension in current output
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (insert-suspended susp-name)
Emit into the current output the output suspended under a given
diversion name.

   Arguments:
susp-name - the name of the suspended output

3.4.28 `last-for?' - detect last iteration
------------------------------------------

Usage:  (last-for? [ for_var ])
Returns SCM_BOOL_T if the named FOR loop (or, if not named, the current
innermost loop) is on the last pass through the data.  Outside of any
FOR loop, it returns SCM_UNDEFINED.  *Note FOR::.

   Arguments:
for_var - Optional - which for loop

3.4.29 `len' - get count of values
----------------------------------

Usage:  (len ag-name)
If the named object is a group definition, then "len" is the same as
"count".  Otherwise, if it is one or more text definitions, then it is
the sum of their string lengths.  If it is a single text definition,
then it is equivalent to `(string-length (get "ag-name"))'.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value

3.4.30 `low-lim' - get lowest value index
-----------------------------------------

Usage:  (low-lim ag-name)
Returns the lowest index associated with an array of definitions.

   Arguments:
ag-name - name of AutoGen value

3.4.31 `make-header-guard' - make self-inclusion guard
------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (make-header-guard name)
This function will create a `#ifndef'/`#define' sequence for protecting
a header from multiple evaluation.  It will also set the Scheme
variable `header-file' to the name of the file being protected and it
will set `header-guard' to the name of the `#define' being used to
protect it.  It is expected that this will be used as follows:
     [+ (make-header-guard "group_name") +]
     ...
     #endif /* [+ (. header-guard) +] */

     #include "[+ (. header-file)  +]"
   The `#define' name is composed as follows:

  1. The first element is the string argument and a separating
     underscore.

  2. That is followed by the name of the header file with illegal
     characters mapped to underscores.

  3. The end of the name is always, "`_GUARD'".

  4. Finally, the entire string is mapped to upper case.

   The final `#define' name is stored in an SCM symbol named
`header-guard'.  Consequently, the concluding `#endif' for the file
should read something like:

     #endif /* [+ (. header-guard) +] */

   The name of the header file (the current output file) is also stored
in an SCM symbol, `header-file'.  Therefore, if you are also generating
a C file that uses the previously generated header file, you can put
this into that generated file:

     #include "[+ (. header-file) +]"

   Obviously, if you are going to produce more than one header file from
a particular template, you will need to be careful how these SCM symbols
get handled.

   Arguments:
name - header group name

3.4.32 `make-tmp-dir' - create a temporary directory
----------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (make-tmp-dir)
Create a directory that will be cleaned up upon exit.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.

3.4.33 `match-value?' - test for matching value
-----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (match-value? op ag-name test-str)
This function answers the question, "Is there an AutoGen value named
`ag-name' with a value that matches the pattern `test-str' using the
match function `op'?"  Return SCM_BOOL_T iff at least one occurrence of
the specified name has such a value.  The operator can be any function
that takes two string arguments and yields a boolean.  It is expected
that you will use one of the string matching functions provided by
AutoGen.
The value name must follow the same rules as the `ag-name' argument for
`exist?' (*note SCM exist?::).

   Arguments:
op - boolean result operator
ag-name - name of AutoGen value
test-str - string to test against

3.4.34 `max-file-time' - get the maximum input file modification time
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (max-file-time)
returns the time stamp of the most recently modified sourc file as the
number of seconds since the epoch.  If any input is dynamic (a shell
command), then it will be the current time.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.

3.4.35 `mk-gettextable' - print a string in a gettext-able format
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (mk-gettextable string)
Returns SCM_UNDEFINED.  The input text string is printed to the current
output as one puts() call per paragraph.

   Arguments:
string - a multi-paragraph string

3.4.36 `out-delete' - delete current output file
------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-delete)
Remove the current output file.  Cease processing the template for the
current suffix.  It is an error if there are `push'-ed output files.
Use the `(error "0")' scheme function instead.  *Note output controls::.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.

3.4.37 `out-depth' - output file stack depth
--------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-depth)
Returns the depth of the output file stack.  *Note output controls::.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.

3.4.38 `out-emit-suspended' - emit the text of suspended output
---------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-emit-suspended susp_nm)
This function is equivalent to `(begin (out-resume <name>) (out-pop
#t))'

   Arguments:
susp_nm - A name tag of suspended output

3.4.39 `out-line' - output file line number
-------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-line)
Returns the current line number of the output file.  It rewinds and
reads the file to count newlines.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.

3.4.40 `out-move' - change name of output file
----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-move new-name)
Rename current output file.  *Note output controls::.  Please note:
changing the name will not save a temporary file from being deleted.
It may, however, be used on the root output file.

   Arguments:
new-name - new name for the current output file

3.4.41 `out-name' - current output file name
--------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-name)
Returns the name of the current output file.  If the current file is a
temporary, unnamed file, then it will scan up the chain until a real
output file name is found.  *Note output controls::.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.

3.4.42 `out-pop' - close current output file
--------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-pop [ disp ])
If there has been a `push' on the output, then close that file and go
back to the previously open file.  It is an error if there has not been
a `push'.  *Note output controls::.

   If there is no argument, no further action is taken.  Otherwise, the
argument should be `#t' and the contents of the file are returned by
the function.

   Arguments:
disp - Optional - return contents of the file

3.4.43 `out-push-add' - append output to file
---------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-push-add file-name)
Identical to `push-new', except the contents are *not* purged, but
appended to.  *Note output controls::.

   Arguments:
file-name - name of the file to append text to

3.4.44 `out-push-new' - purge and create output file
----------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-push-new [ file-name ])
Leave the current output file open, but purge and create a new file
that will remain open until a `pop' `delete' or `switch' closes it.
The file name is optional and, if omitted, the output will be sent to a
temporary file that will be deleted when it is closed.  *Note output
controls::.

   Arguments:
file-name - Optional - name of the file to create

3.4.45 `out-resume' - resume suspended output file
--------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-resume susp_nm)
If there has been a suspended output, then make that output descriptor
current again.  That output must have been suspended with the same tag
name given to this routine as its argument.

   Arguments:
susp_nm - A name tag for reactivating

3.4.46 `out-suspend' - suspend current output file
--------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-suspend suspName)
If there has been a `push' on the output, then set aside the output
descriptor for later reactiviation with `(out-resume "xxx")'.  The tag
name need not reflect the name of the output file.  In fact, the output
file may be an anonymous temporary file.  You may also change the tag
every time you suspend output to a file, because the tag names are
forgotten as soon as the file has been "resumed".

   Arguments:
suspName - A name tag for reactivating

3.4.47 `out-switch' - close and create new output
-------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (out-switch file-name)
Switch output files - close current file and make the current file
pointer refer to the new file.  This is equivalent to `out-pop'
followed by `out-push-new', except that you may not pop the base level
output file, but you may `switch' it.  *Note output controls::.

   Arguments:
file-name - name of the file to create

3.4.48 `output-file-next-line' - print the file name and next line number
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (output-file-next-line [ line_off ] [ alt_fmt ])
Returns a string with the current output file name and line number.
The default format is: # <line+1> "<output-file-name>" The argument may
be either a number indicating an offset from the current output line
number or an alternate formatting string.  If both are provided, then
the first must be a numeric offset.

   Be careful that you are directing output to the final output file.
Otherwise, you will get the file name and line number of the temporary
file.  That won't be what you want.

   Arguments:
line_off - Optional - offset to line number
alt_fmt - Optional - alternate format string

3.4.49 `set-option' - Set a command line option
-----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (set-option opt)
The text argument must be an option name followed by any needed option
argument.  Returns SCM_UNDEFINED.

   Arguments:
opt - AutoGen option name + its argument

3.4.50 `set-writable' - Make the output file be writable
--------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (set-writable [ set? ])
This function will set the current output file to be writable (or not).
This is only effective if neither the `--writable' nor `--not-writable'
have been specified.  This state is reset when the current suffix's
output is complete.

   Arguments:
set? - Optional - boolean arg, false to make output non-writable

3.4.51 `stack' - make list of AutoGen values
--------------------------------------------

Usage:  (stack ag-name)
Create a scheme list of all the strings that are associated with a
name.  They must all be text values or we choke.

   Arguments:
ag-name - AutoGen value name

3.4.52 `stack-join' - stack values then join them
-------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (stack-join join ag-name)
This function will collect all the values named `ag-name' (see the
*note stack function: SCM stack.) and join them separated by the `join'
string (see the *note join function: SCM join.).

   Arguments:
join - string between each element
ag-name - name of autogen values to stack

3.4.53 `suffix' - get the current suffix
----------------------------------------

Usage:  (suffix)
Returns the current active suffix (*note pseudo macro::).

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.

3.4.54 `tpl-file' - get the template file name
----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (tpl-file [ full_path ])
Returns the name of the current template file.  If `#t' is passed in as
an argument, then the template file is hunted for in the template
search path.  Otherwise, just the unadorned name.

   Arguments:
full_path - Optional - include full path to file

3.4.55 `tpl-file-line' - get the template file+line number
----------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (tpl-file-line [ msg-fmt ])
Returns the file and line number of the current template macro using
either the default format, "from %s line %d", or else the format you
supply.  For example, if you want to insert a "C" language file-line
directive, you would supply the format "# %2$d \"%1$s\"", but that is
also already supplied with the scheme variable *Note SCM
c-file-line-fmt::.  You may use it thus:
     (tpl-file-line c-file-line-fmt)

   It is also safe to use the formatting string, "%2$d".  AutoGen uses
an argument vector version of printf: *Note snprintfv::, and it does
not need to know the types of each argument in order to skip forward to
the second argument.

   Arguments:
msg-fmt - Optional - formatting for line message

3.4.56 `tpl-file-next-line' - get the template file plus next line number
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (tpl-file-next-line [ msg-fmt ])
This is almost the same as *Note SCM tpl-file-line::, except that the
line referenced is the next line, per C compiler conventions, and
consequently defaults to the format:  # <line-no+1> "<file-name>"

   Arguments:
msg-fmt - Optional - formatting for line message

3.4.57 `warn' - display warning message and continue
----------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (warn message)
The argument is a string that printed out to stderr.  The message is
formed from the formatting string:

     `WARNING:'  %s\n

   The template processing resumes after printing the message.

   Arguments:
message - message to display

3.4.58 `autogen-version' - autogen version number
-------------------------------------------------

This is a symbol defining the current AutoGen version number string.
It was first defined in AutoGen-5.2.14.  It is currently "5.18.6pre15".

3.4.59 format file info as, "`#line nn "file"'"
-----------------------------------------------

This is a symbol that can easily be used with the functions *Note SCM
tpl-file-line::, and *Note SCM def-file-line::.  These will emit C
program `#line' directives pointing to template and definitions text,
respectively.

3.5 Common Scheme Functions
===========================

This section describes a number of general purpose functions that make
the kind of string processing that AutoGen does a little easier.
Unlike the AutoGen specific functions (*note AutoGen Functions::),
these functions are available for direct use during definition load
time.  The equality test (*note SCM =::) is "overloaded" to do string
equivalence comparisons.  If you are looking for inequality, the
Scheme/Lisp way of spelling that is, "(not (= ...))".

3.5.1 `agpl' - GNU Affero General Public License
------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (agpl prog-name prefix)
Emit a string that contains the GNU Affero General Public License.
This function is now deprecated.  Please *Note SCM
license-description::.

   Arguments:
prog-name - name of the program under the GPL
prefix - String for starting each output line

3.5.2 `bsd' - BSD Public License
--------------------------------

Usage:  (bsd prog_name owner prefix)
Emit a string that contains the Free BSD Public License.  This function
is now deprecated.  Please *Note SCM license-description::.

   Arguments:
prog_name - name of the program under the BSD
owner - Grantor of the BSD License
prefix - String for starting each output line

3.5.3 `c-string' - emit string for ANSI C
-----------------------------------------

Usage:  (c-string string)
Reform a string so that, when printed, the C compiler will be able to
compile the data and construct a string that contains exactly what the
current string contains.  Many non-printing characters are replaced with
escape sequences.  Newlines are replaced with a backslash, an `n', a
closing quote, a newline, seven spaces and another re-opening quote.
The compiler will implicitly concatenate them.  The reader will see line
breaks.

   A K&R compiler will choke.  Use `kr-string' for that compiler.

   Arguments:
string - string to reformat

3.5.4 `error-source-line' - display of file & line
--------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (error-source-line)
This function is only invoked just before Guile displays an error
message.  It displays the file name and line number that triggered the
evaluation error.  You should not need to invoke this routine directly.
Guile will do it automatically.

   This Scheme function takes no arguments.

3.5.5 `extract' - extract text from another file
------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (extract file-name marker-fmt [ caveat ] [ default ])
This function is used to help construct output files that may contain
text that is carried from one version of the output to the next.

   The first two arguments are required, the second are optional:

   * The `file-name' argument is used to name the file that contains
     the demarcated text.

   * The `marker-fmt' is a formatting string that is used to construct
     the starting and ending demarcation strings.  The sprintf function
     is given the `marker-fmt' with two arguments.  The first is either
     "START" or "END".  The second is either "DO NOT CHANGE THIS
     COMMENT" or the optional `caveat' argument.

   * `caveat' is presumed to be absent if it is the empty string
     (`""').  If absent, "DO NOT CHANGE THIS COMMENT" is used as the
     second string argument to the `marker-fmt'.

   * When a `default' argument is supplied and no pre-existing text is
     found, then this text will be inserted between the START and END
     markers.

The resulting strings are presumed to be unique within the subject
file.  As a simplified example:

     [+ (extract "fname" "// %s - SOMETHING - %s" ""
     "example default") +]
   will result in the following text being inserted into the output:

     // START - SOMETHING - DO NOT CHANGE THIS COMMENT
     example default
     // END   - SOMETHING - DO NOT CHANGE THIS COMMENT

The "`example default'" string can then be carried forward to the next
generation of the output, *provided* the output is not named "`fname'"
and the old output is renamed to "`fname'" before AutoGen-eration
begins.

*NB:*
     You can set aside previously generated source files inside the
     pseudo macro with a Guile/scheme function, extract the text you
     want to keep with this extract function.  Just remember you should
     delete it at the end, too.  Here is an example from my Finite
     State Machine generator:

          [+ AutoGen5 Template  -*- Mode: text -*-
          h=%s-fsm.h   c=%s-fsm.c
          (shellf
          "test -f %1$s-fsm.h && mv -f %1$s-fsm.h .fsm.head
          test -f %1$s-fsm.c && mv -f %1$s-fsm.c .fsm.code" (base-name))
          +]

     This code will move the two previously produced output files to
     files named ".fsm.head" and ".fsm.code".  At the end of the 'c'
     output processing, I delete them.

*also NB:*
     This function presumes that the output file ought to be editable so
     that the code between the `START' and `END' marks can be edited by
     the template user.  Consequently, when the `(extract ...)' function
     is invoked, if the `writable' option has not been specified, then
     it will be set at that point.  If this is not the desired
     behavior, the `--not-writable' command line option will override
     this.  Also, you may use the guile function `(chmod "file"
     mode-value)' to override whatever AutoGen is using for the result
     mode.

   Arguments:
file-name - name of file with text
marker-fmt - format for marker text
caveat - Optional - warn about changing marker
default - Optional - default initial text

3.5.6 `format-arg-count' - count the args to a format
-----------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (format-arg-count format)
Sometimes, it is useful to simply be able to figure out how many
arguments are required by a format string.  For example, if you are
extracting a format string for the purpose of generating a macro to
invoke a printf-like function, you can run the formatting string
through this function to determine how many arguments to provide for in
the macro. e.g. for this extraction text:

      /*=fumble bumble
       * fmt: 'stumble %s: %d\n'
      =*/

You may wish to generate a macro:

      #define BUMBLE(a1,a2) printf_like(something,(a1),(a2))

You can do this by knowing that the format needs two arguments.

   Arguments:
format - formatting string

3.5.7 `fprintf' - format to a file
----------------------------------

Usage:  (fprintf port format [ format-arg ... ])
Format a string using arguments from the alist.  Write to a specified
port.  The result will NOT appear in your output.  Use this to print
information messages to a template user.

   Arguments:
port - Guile-scheme output port
format - formatting string
format-arg - Optional - list of arguments to formatting string

3.5.8 `gperf' - perform a perfect hash function
-----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (gperf name str)
Perform the perfect hash on the input string.  This is only useful if
you have previously created a gperf program with the `make-gperf'
function *Note SCM make-gperf::.  The `name' you supply here must match
the name used to create the program and the string to hash must be one
of the strings supplied in the `make-gperf' string list.  The result
will be a perfect hash index.

   See the documentation for `gperf(1GNU)' for more details.

   Arguments:
name - name of hash list
str - string to hash

3.5.9 `gperf-code' - emit the source of the generated gperf program
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (gperf-code st-name)
Returns the contents of the emitted code, suitable for inclusion in
another program.  The interface contains the following elements:

`struct <st-name>_index'
     containg the fields: `{char const * name, int const id; };'

`<st-name>_hash()'
     This is the hashing function with local only scope (static).

`<st-name>_find()'
     This is the searching and validation function.  The first argument
     is the string to look up, the second is its length.  It returns a
     pointer to the corresponding `<st-name>_index' entry.

   Use this in your template as follows where "<st-name>" was set to be
"`lookup'":

     [+ (make-gperf "lookup" (join "\n" (stack "name_list")))
     (gperf-code "lookup") +]
     void my_fun(char * str) {
     struct lookup_index * li = lookup_find(str, strlen(str));
     if (li != NULL) printf("%s yields %d\n", str, li->idx);

   Arguments:
st-name - the name of the gperf hash list

3.5.10 `gpl' - GNU General Public License
-----------------------------------------

Usage:  (gpl prog-name prefix)
Emit a string that contains the GNU General Public License.  This
function is now deprecated.  Please *Note SCM license-description::.

   Arguments:

prefix - String for starting each output line

3.5.11 `hide-email' - convert eaddr to javascript
-------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (hide-email display eaddr)
Hides an email address as a java scriptlett.  The 'mailto:' tag and the
email address are coded bytes rather than plain text.  They are also
broken up.

   Arguments:
display - display text
eaddr - email address

3.5.12 `html-escape-encode' - encode html special characters
------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (html-escape-encode str)
This function will replace replace the characters `'&'', `'<'' and
`'>'' characters with the HTML/XML escape-encoded strings (`"&amp;"',
`"&lt;"', and `"&gt;"', respectively).

   Arguments:
str - string to make substitutions in

3.5.13 `in?' - test for string in list
--------------------------------------

Usage:  (in? test-string string-list ...)
Return SCM_BOOL_T if the first argument string is found in one of the
entries in the second (list-of-strings) argument.

   Arguments:
test-string - string to look for
string-list - list of strings to check

3.5.14 `join' - join string list with separator
-----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (join separator list ...)
With the first argument as the separator string, joins together an
a-list of strings into one long string.  The list may contain nested
lists, partly because you cannot always control that.

   Arguments:
separator - string to insert between entries
list - list of strings to join

3.5.15 `kr-string' - emit string for K&R C
------------------------------------------

Usage:  (kr-string string)
Reform a string so that, when printed, a K&R C compiler will be able to
compile the data and construct a string that contains exactly what the
current string contains.  Many non-printing characters are replaced
with escape sequences.  New-lines are replaced with a
backslash-n-backslash and newline sequence,

   Arguments:
string - string to reformat

3.5.16 `lgpl' - GNU Library General Public License
--------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (lgpl prog_name owner prefix)

This function is now deprecated.  Please *Note SCM
license-description::.

   Arguments:
prog_name - name of the program under the LGPL
owner - Grantor of the LGPL
prefix - String for starting each output line

3.5.17 `license' - an arbitrary license
---------------------------------------

Usage:  (license lic_name prog_name owner prefix)
Emit a string that contains the named license.  This function is now
deprecated.  Please *Note SCM license-description::.

   Arguments:
lic_name - file name of the license
prog_name - name of the licensed program or library
owner - Grantor of the License
prefix - String for starting each output line

3.5.18 `license-description' - Emit a license description
---------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (license-description license prog-name prefix [ owner ])
Emit a string that contains a detailed license description, with
substitutions for program name, copyright holder and a per-line prefix.
This is the text typically used as part of a source file header.  For
more details, *Note the license-full command: SCM license-full.

   Arguments:
license - name of license type
prog-name - name of the program under the GPL
prefix - String for starting each output line
owner - Optional - owner of the program

3.5.19 `license-full' - Emit the licensing information and description
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (license-full license prog-name prefix [ owner ] [ years ])
Emit all the text that `license-info' and `license-description' would
emit (*note `license-info': SCM license-info, and *note
`license-description': SCM license-description.), with all the same
substitutions.

   All of these depend upon the existence of a license file named after
the `license' argument with a `.lic' suffix.  That file should contain
three blocks of text, each separated by two or more consecutive newline
characters (at least one completely blank line).

   The first section describes copyright attribution and the name of
the usage licence.  For GNU software, this should be the text that is
to be displayed with the program version.  Four text markers can be
replaced: <PFX>, <program>, <years> and <owner>.

   The second section is a short description of the terms of the
license.  This is typically the kind of text that gets displayed in the
header of source files.  Only the <PFX>, <owner> and <program> markers
are substituted.

   The third section is strictly the name of the license.  No marker
substitutions are performed.

     <PFX>Copyright (C) <years> <owner>, all rights reserved.
     <PFX>
     <PFX>This is free software. It is licensed for use,
     <PFX>modification and redistribution under the terms
     <PFX>of the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later
     <PFX>    <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>

     <PFX><program> is free software: you can redistribute it
     <PFX>and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General
     <PFX>Public License as published by the Free Software ...

     the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later

   Arguments:
license - name of license type
prog-name - name of the program under the GPL
prefix - String for starting each output line
owner - Optional - owner of the program
years - Optional - copyright years

3.5.20 `license-info' - Emit the licensing information and copyright years
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (license-info license prog-name prefix [ owner ] [ years ])
Emit a string that contains the licensing description, with some
substitutions for program name, copyright holder, a list of years when
the source was modified, and a per-line prefix.  This text typically
includes a brief license description and is often printed out when a
program starts running or as part of the `--version' output.  For more
details, *Note the license-full command: SCM license-full.

   Arguments:
license - name of license type
prog-name - name of the program under the GPL
prefix - String for starting each output line
owner - Optional - owner of the program
years - Optional - copyright years

3.5.21 `license-name' - Emit the name of the license
----------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (license-name license)
Emit a string that contains the full name of the license.

   Arguments:
license - name of license type

3.5.22 `make-gperf' - build a perfect hash function program
-----------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (make-gperf name strings ...)
Build a program to perform perfect hashes of a known list of input
strings.  This function produces no output, but prepares a program
named, `gperf_<name>' for use by the gperf function *Note SCM gperf::.

   This program will be obliterated as AutoGen exits.  However, you may
incorporate the generated hashing function into your C program with
commands something like the following:

     [+ (shellf "sed '/^int main(/,$d;/^#line/d' ${gpdir}/%s.c"
     name ) +]

   where `name' matches the name provided to this `make-perf' function.
`gpdir' is the variable used to store the name of the temporary
directory used to stash all the files.

   Arguments:
name - name of hash list
strings - list of strings to hash

3.5.23 `makefile-script' - create makefile script
-------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (makefile-script text)
This function will take ordinary shell script text and reformat it so
that it will work properly inside of a makefile shell script.  Not
every shell construct can be supported; the intent is to have most
ordinary scripts work without much, if any, alteration.

   The following transformations are performed on the source text:

  1. Trailing whitespace on each line is stripped.

  2. Except for the last line, the string, " ; \\" is appended to the
     end of every line that does not end with certain special
     characters or keywords.  Note that this will mutilate multi-line
     quoted strings, but `make' renders it impossible to use multi-line
     constructs anyway.

  3. If the line ends with a backslash, it is left alone.

  4. If the line ends with a semi-colon, conjunction operator, pipe
     (vertical bar) or one of the keywords "then", "else" or "in", then
     a space and a backslash is added, but no semi-colon.

  5. The dollar sign character is doubled, unless it immediately
     precedes an opening parenthesis or the single character make
     macros '*', '<', '@', '?' or '%'.  Other single character make
     macros that do not have enclosing parentheses will fail.  For
     shell usage of the "$@", "$?" and "$*" macros, you must enclose
     them with curly braces, e.g., "${?}".  The ksh construct
     `$(<command>)' will not work.  Though some `make's accept `${var}'
     constructs, this function will assume it is for shell
     interpretation and double the dollar character.  You must use
     `$(var)' for all `make' substitutions.

  6. Double dollar signs are replaced by four before the next character
     is examined.

  7. Every line is prefixed with a tab, unless the first line already
     starts with a tab.

  8. The newline character on the last line, if present, is suppressed.

  9. Blank lines are stripped.

 10. Lines starting with "@ifdef", "@ifndef", "@else" and "@endif" are
     presumed to be autoconf "sed" expression tags.  These lines will be
     emitted as-is, with no tab prefix and no line splicing backslash.
     These lines can then be processed at configure time with
     `AC_CONFIG_FILES' sed expressions, similar to:

          sed "/^@ifdef foo/d;/^@endif foo/d;/^@ifndef foo/,/^@endif foo/d"

This function is intended to be used approximately as follows:

     $(TARGET) : $(DEPENDENCIES)
     <+ (out-push-new) +>
     ....mostly arbitrary shell script text....
     <+ (makefile-script (out-pop #t)) +>

   Arguments:
text - the text of the script

3.5.24 `max' - maximum value in list
------------------------------------

Usage:  (max list ...)
Return the maximum value in the list

   Arguments:
list - list of values.  Strings are converted to numbers

3.5.25 `min' - minimum value in list
------------------------------------

Usage:  (min list ...)
Return the minimum value in the list

   Arguments:
list - list of values.  Strings are converted to numbers

3.5.26 `prefix' - prefix lines with a string
--------------------------------------------

Usage:  (prefix prefix text)
Prefix every line in the second string with the first string.  This
includes empty lines, though trailing white space will be removed if
the line consists only of the "prefix".  Also, if the last character is
a newline, then *two* prefixes will be inserted into the result text.

   For example, if the first string is "# " and the second contains:
     "two\nlines\n"
   The result string will contain:
     # two
     # lines
     #

   The last line will be incomplete:  no newline and no space after the
hash character, either.

   Arguments:
prefix - string to insert at start of each line
text - multi-line block of text

3.5.27 `printf' - format to stdout
----------------------------------

Usage:  (printf format [ format-arg ... ])
Format a string using arguments from the alist.  Write to the standard
out port.  The result will NOT appear in your output.  Use this to
print information messages to a template user.  Use "(sprintf ...)" to
add text to your document.

   Arguments:
format - formatting string
format-arg - Optional - list of arguments to formatting string

3.5.28 `raw-shell-str' - single quote shell string
--------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (raw-shell-str string)
Convert the text of the string into a singly quoted string that a
normal shell will process into the original string.  (It will not do
macro expansion later, either.)  Contained single quotes become
tripled, with the middle quote escaped with a backslash.  Normal shells
will reconstitute the original string.

   *Notice*:  some shells will not correctly handle unusual
non-printing characters.  This routine works for most reasonably
conventional ASCII strings.

   Arguments:
string - string to transform

3.5.29 `shell' - invoke a shell script
--------------------------------------

Usage:  (shell command ...)
Generate a string by writing the value to a server shell and reading the
output back in.  The template programmer is responsible for ensuring
that it completes within 10 seconds.  If it does not, the server will be
killed, the output tossed and a new server started.

   Please note: This is the same server process used by the '#shell'
definitions directive and backquoted ``' definitions.  There may be
left over state from previous shell expressions and the ``' processing
in the declarations.  However, a `cd' to the original directory is
always issued before the new command is issued.

   Also note:  When initializing, autogen will set the environment
variable "AGexe" to the full path of the autogen executable.

   Arguments:
command - shell command - the result is from stdout

3.5.30 `shell-str' - double quote shell string
----------------------------------------------

Usage:  (shell-str string)
Convert the text of the string into a double quoted string that a normal
shell will process into the original string, almost.  It will add the
escape character `\\' before two special characters to accomplish this:
the backslash `\\' and double quote `"'.

   *Notice*: some shells will not correctly handle unusual non-printing
characters.  This routine works for most reasonably conventional ASCII
strings.

   *WARNING*:
This function omits the extra backslash in front of a backslash,
however, if it is followed by either a backquote or a dollar sign.  It
must do this because otherwise it would be impossible to protect the
dollar sign or backquote from shell evaluation.  Consequently, it is
not possible to render the strings "\\$" or "\\`".  The lesser of two
evils.

   All others characters are copied directly into the output.

   The `sub-shell-str' variation of this routine behaves identically,
except that the extra backslash is omitted in front of `"' instead of
``'.  You have to think about it.  I'm open to suggestions.

   Meanwhile, the best way to document is with a detailed output
example.  If the backslashes make it through the text processing
correctly, below you will see what happens with three example strings.
The first example string contains a list of quoted `foo's, the second is
the same with a single backslash before the quote characters and the
last is with two backslash escapes.  Below each is the result of the
`raw-shell-str', `shell-str' and `sub-shell-str' functions.

     foo[0]           ''foo'' 'foo' "foo" `foo` $foo
     raw-shell-str -> \'\''foo'\'\'' '\''foo'\'' "foo" `foo` $foo'
     shell-str     -> "''foo'' 'foo' \"foo\" `foo` $foo"
     sub-shell-str -> `''foo'' 'foo' "foo" \`foo\` $foo`

     foo[1]           \'bar\' \"bar\" \`bar\` \$bar
     raw-shell-str -> '\'\''bar\'\'' \"bar\" \`bar\` \$bar'
     shell-str     -> "\\'bar\\' \\\"bar\\\" \`bar\` \$bar"
     sub-shell-str -> `\\'bar\\' \"bar\" \\\`bar\\\` \$bar`

     foo[2]           \\'BAZ\\' \\"BAZ\\" \\`BAZ\\` \\$BAZ
     raw-shell-str -> '\\'\''BAZ\\'\'' \\"BAZ\\" \\`BAZ\\` \\$BAZ'
     shell-str     -> "\\\\'BAZ\\\\' \\\\\"BAZ\\\\\" \\\`BAZ\\\` \\\$BAZ"
     sub-shell-str -> `\\\\'BAZ\\\\' \\\"BAZ\\\" \\\\\`BAZ\\\\\` \\\$BAZ`

   There should be four, three, five and three backslashes for the four
examples on the last line, respectively.  The next to last line should
have four, five, three and three backslashes.  If this was not
accurately reproduced, take a look at the agen5/test/shell.test test.
Notice the backslashes in front of the dollar signs.  It goes from zero
to one to three for the "cooked" string examples.

   Arguments:
string - string to transform

3.5.31 `shellf' - format a string, run shell

     (list "&amp;" "&lt;" "&gt;"))

   Arguments:
source - string to transform
match - substring or substring list to be replaced
repl - replacement strings or substrings

3.5.54 `string-table-add' - Add an entry to a string table
----------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string-table-add st-name str-val)
Check for a duplicate string and, if none, then insert a new string
into the string table.  In all cases, returns the character index of
the beginning of the string in the table.

   The returned index can be used in expressions like:
     string_array + <returned-value>
   that will yield the address of the first byte of the inserted
string.  See the `strtable.test' AutoGen test for a usage example.

   Arguments:
st-name - the name of the array of characters
str-val - the (possibly) new value to add

3.5.55 `string-table-add-ref' - Add an entry to a string table, get reference
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string-table-add-ref st-name str-val)
Identical to string-table-add, except the value returned is the string
"st-name" '+' and the index returned by string-table-add.

   Arguments:
st-name - the name of the array of characters
str-val - the (possibly) new value to add

3.5.56 `string-table-new' - create a string table
-------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string-table-new st-name)
This function will create an array of characters.  The companion
functions, (*Note SCM string-table-add::, *Note SCM
string-table-add-ref::, and *note SCM emit-string-table::) will insert
text and emit the populated table.

   With these functions, it should be much easier to construct
structures containing string offsets instead of string pointers.  That
can be very useful when transmitting, storing or sharing data with
different address spaces.

Here is a brief example copied from the strtable.test test:

     [+ (string-table-new "scribble")
        (out-push-new) ;; redirect output to temporary
        (define ct 1)  +][+

     FOR str IN that was the week that was +][+
       (set! ct (+ ct 1))
     +]
         [+ (string-table-add-ref "scribble" (get "str")) +],[+
     ENDFOR  +]
     [+ (out-suspend "main")
        (emit-string-table "scribble")
        (ag-fprintf 0 "\nchar const *ap[%d] = {" ct)
        (out-resume "main")
        (out-pop #t) ;; now dump out the redirected output +]
         NULL };

Some explanation:

I added the `(out-push-new)' because the string table text is diverted
into an output stream named, "scribble" and I want to have the string
table emitted before the string table references.  The string table
references are also emitted inside the `FOR' loop.  So, when the loop
is done, the current output is suspended under the name, "main" and the
"scribble" table is then emitted into the primary output.
(`emit-string-table' inserts its output directly into the current
output stream.  It does not need to be the last function in an AutoGen
macro block.)  Next I `ag-fprintf' the array-of-pointer declaration
directly into the current output.  Finally I restore the "main" output
stream and `(out-pop #t)'-it into the main output stream.

   Here is the result.  Note that duplicate strings are not repeated in
the string table:

     static char const scribble[18] =
         "that\0" "was\0"  "the\0"  "week\0";

     char const *ap[7] = {
         scribble+0,
         scribble+5,
         scribble+9,
         scribble+13,
         scribble+0,
         scribble+5,
         NULL };

   These functions use the global name space `stt-*' in addition to the
function names.

   If you utilize this in your programming, it is recommended that you
prevent printf format usage warnings with the GCC option
`-Wno-format-contains-nul'

   Arguments:
st-name - the name of the array of characters

3.5.57 `string-table-size' - print the current size of a string table
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string-table-size st-name)
Returns the current byte count of the string table.

   Arguments:
st-name - the name of the array of characters

3.5.58 `string->c-name!' - map non-name chars to underscore
-----------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string->c-name! str)
Change all the graphic characters that are invalid in a C name token
into underscores.  Whitespace characters are ignored.  Any other
character type (i.e. non-graphic and non-white) will cause a failure.

   Arguments:
str - input/output string

3.5.59 `string->camelcase' - make a string be CamelCase
-------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string->camelcase str)
Capitalize the first letter of each block of letters and numbers, and
stripping out characters that are not alphanumerics.  For example,
"alpha-beta0gamma" becomes "AlphaBeta0gamma".

   Arguments:
str - input/output string

3.5.60 `string-tr' - convert characters with new result
-------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string-tr source match translation)
This is identical to `string-tr!', except that it does not over-write
the previous value.

   Arguments:
source - string to transform
match - characters to be converted
translation - conversion list

3.5.61 `string-tr!' - convert characters
----------------------------------------

Usage:  (string-tr! source match translation)
This is the same as the `tr(1)' program, except the string to transform
is the first argument.  The second and third arguments are used to
construct mapping arrays for the transformation of the first argument.

   It is too bad this little program has so many different and
incompatible implementations!

   Arguments:
source - string to transform
match - characters to be converted
translation - conversion list

3.5.62 `string-upcase' - upper case a new string
------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string-upcase str)
Create a new SCM string containing the same text as the original, only
all the lower case letters are changed to upper case.

   Arguments:
str - input string

3.5.63 `string-upcase!' - make a string be upper case
-----------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (string-upcase! str)
Change to upper case all the characters in an SCM string.

   Arguments:
str - input/output string

3.5.64 `sub-shell-str' - back quoted (sub-)shell string
-------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (sub-shell-str string)
This function is substantially identical to `shell-str', except that
the quoting character is ``' and the "leave the escape alone" character
is `"'.

   Arguments:
string - string to transform

3.5.65 `sum' - sum of values in list
------------------------------------

Usage:  (sum list ...)
Compute the sum of the list of expressions.

   Arguments:
list - list of values.  Strings are converted to numbers

3.5.66 `time-string->number' - duration string to seconds
---------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (time-string->number time_spec)
Convert the argument string to a time period in seconds.  The string
may use multiple parts consisting of days, hours minutes and seconds.
These are indicated with a suffix of `d', `h', `m' and `s' respectively.
Hours, minutes and seconds may also be represented with `HH:MM:SS' or,
without hours, as `MM:SS'.

   Arguments:
time_spec - string to parse

3.5.67 `version-compare' - compare two version numbers
------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  (version-compare op v1 v2)
Converts v1 and v2 strings into 64 bit values and returns the result of
running 'op' on those values.  It assumes that the version is a 1 to 4
part dot-separated series of numbers.  Suffixes like, "5pre4" or
"5-pre4" will be interpreted as two numbers.  The first number ("5" in
this case) will be decremented and the number after the "pre" will be
added to 0xC000.  (Unless your platform is unable to support 64 bit
integer arithmetic.  Then it will be added to 0xC0.)  Consequently,
these yield true:
     (version-compare > "5.8.5"       "5.8.5-pre4")
     (version-compare > "5.8.5-pre10" "5.8.5-pre4")

   Arguments:
op - comparison operator
v1 - first version
v2 - compared-to version

3.6 AutoGen Native Macros
=========================

This section describes the various AutoGen natively defined macros.
Unlike the Scheme functions, some of these macros are "block macros"
with a scope that extends through a terminating macro.  Block macros
must not overlap.  That is to say, a block macro started within the
scope of an encompassing block macro must have its matching end macro
appear before the encompassing block macro is either ended or
subdivided.

   The block macros are these:

`CASE'
     This macro has scope through the `ESAC' macro.  The scope is
     subdivided by `SELECT' macros.  You must have at least one
     `SELECT' macro.

`DEFINE'
     This macro has scope through the `ENDDEF' macro.  The defined user
     macro can never be a block macro.  This macro is extracted from
     the template before the template is processed.  Consequently, you
     cannot select a definition based on context.  You can, however,
     place them all at the end of the file.

`FOR'
     This macro has scope through the `ENDFOR' macro.

`IF'
     This macro has scope through the `ENDIF' macro.  The scope may be
     subdivided by `ELIF' and `ELSE' macros.  Obviously, there may be
     only one `ELSE' macro and it must be the last of these
     subdivisions.

`INCLUDE'
     This macro has the scope of the included file.  It is a block
     macro in the sense that the included file must not contain any
     incomplete block macros.

`WHILE'
     This macro has scope through the `ENDWHILE' macro.


3.6.1 AutoGen Macro Syntax
--------------------------

The general syntax is:

     [ { <native-macro-name> | <user-defined-name> } ] [ <arg> ... ]

The syntax for `<arg>' depends on the particular macro, but is
generally a full expression (*note expression syntax::).  Here are the
exceptions to that general rule:

  1. `INVOKE' macros, implicit or explicit, must be followed by a list
     of name/string value pairs.  The string values are simple
     expressions, as described above.

     That is, the `INVOKE' syntax is one of these two:
          <user-macro-name> [ <name> [ = <expression> ] ... ]

          INVOKE <name-expression> [ <name> [ = <expression> ] ... ]

  2. AutoGen FOR macros must be in one of three forms:

          FOR <name> [ <separator-string> ]

          FOR <name> (...Scheme expression list)

          FOR <name> IN <string-entry> [ ... ]
     where:
    `<name>'
          must be a simple name.

    `<separator-string>'
          is inserted between copies of the enclosed block.  Do not try
          to use "IN" as your separator string.  It won't work.

    `<string-entry>'
          is an entry in a list of strings.  "`<name>'" is assigned
          each value from the "`IN'" list before expanding the `FOR'
          block.

    `(...Scheme expression list)'
          is expected to contain one or more of the `for-from',
          `for-to', `for-by', and `for-sep' functions.  (*Note FOR::,
          and *note AutoGen Functions::)

     The first two forms iterate over the `FOR' block if `<name>' is
     found in the AutoGen values.  The last form will create the AutoGen
     value named `<name>'.

  3. AutoGen `DEFINE' macros must be followed by a simple name.
     Anything after that is ignored.  Consequently, that "comment space"
     may be used to document any named values the macro expects to have
     set up as arguments.  *Note DEFINE::.

  4. The AutoGen `COMMENT', `ELSE', `ESAC' and the `END*' macros take
     no arguments and ignore everything after the macro name (e.g. see
     *note COMMENT::)

3.6.2 BREAK - Leave a FOR or WHILE macro
----------------------------------------

This will unwind the loop context and resume after ENDFOR/ENDWHILE.
Note that unless this happens to be the last iteration anyway, the
(last-for?) function will never yield "#t".

3.6.3 CASE - Select one of several template blocks
--------------------------------------------------

The arguments are evaluated and converted to a string, if necessary.  A
simple name will be interpreted as an AutoGen value name and its value
will be used by the `SELECT' macros (see the example below and the
expression evaluation function, *note EXPR::).  The scope of the macro
is up to the matching `ESAC' macro.  Within the scope of a `CASE', this
string is matched against case selection macros.  There are sixteen
match macros that are derived from four different ways matches may be
performed, plus an "always true", "true if the AutoGen value was found",
and "true if no AutoGen value was found" matches.  The codes for the
nineteen match macros are formed as follows:

  1. Must the match start matching from the beginning of the string?
     If not, then the match macro code starts with an asterisk (`*').

  2. Must the match finish matching at the end of the string?  If not,
     then the match macro code ends with an asterisk (`*').

  3. Is the match a pattern match or a string comparison?  If a
     comparison, use an equal sign (`=').  If a pattern match, use a
     tilde (`~').

  4. Is the match case sensitive?  If alphabetic case is important,
     double the tilde or equal sign.

  5. Do you need a default match when none of the others match?  Use a
     single asterisk (`*').

  6. Do you need to distinguish between an empty string value and a
     value that was not found?  Use the non-existence test (`!E') before
     testing a full match against an empty string (`== ''').  There is
     also an existence test (`+E'), more for symmetry than for
     practical use.

For example:

     [+ CASE <full-expression> +]
     [+ ~~*  "[Tt]est" +]reg exp must match at start, not at end
     [+ ==   "TeSt"    +]a full-string, case sensitive compare
     [+ =    "TEST"    +]a full-string, case insensitive compare
     [+ !E             +]not exists - matches if no AutoGen value found
     [+ ==   ""        +]expression yielded a zero-length string
     [+ +E             +]exists - matches if there is any value result
     [+ *              +]always match - no testing
     [+ ESAC +]

   `<full-expression>' (*note expression syntax::) may be any
expression, including the use of apply-codes and value-names.  If the
expression yields a number, it is converted to a decimal string.

   These case selection codes have also been implemented as Scheme
expression functions using the same codes.  They are documented in this
texi doc as "string-*?" predicates (*note Common Functions::).

3.6.4 COMMENT - A block of comment to be ignored
------------------------------------------------

This function can be specified by the user, but there will never be a
situation where it will be invoked at emit time.  The macro is actually
removed from the internal representation.

   If the native macro name code is `#', then the entire macro function
is treated as a comment and ignored.

     [+ # say what you want, but no '+' before any ']' chars +]

3.6.5 CONTINUE - Skip to end of a FOR or WHILE macro.
-----------------------------------------------------

This will skip the remainder of the loop and start the next.

3.6.6 DEBUG - Print debug message to trace output
-------------------------------------------------

If the tracing level is at "debug-message" or above (*note autogen
trace::), this macro prints a debug message to trace output.  This
message is not evaluated.  This macro can also be used to set useful
debugger breakpoints.  By inserting [+DEBUG n+] into your template, you
can set a debugger breakpoint on the #n case element below (in the
AutoGen source) and step through the processing of interesting parts of
your template.

   To be useful, you have to have access to the source tree where
autogen was built and the template being processed.  The definitions
are also helpful, but not crucial.  Please contact the author if you
think you might actually want to use this.

3.6.7 DEFINE - Define a user AutoGen macro
------------------------------------------

This function will define a new macro.  You must provide a name for the
macro.  You do not specify any arguments, though the invocation may
specify a set of name/value pairs that are to be active during the
processing of the macro.

     [+ define foo +]
     ... macro body with macro functions ...
     [+ enddef +]
     ... [+ foo bar='raw text' baz=<<text expression>> +]

   Once the macro has been defined, this new macro can be invoked by
specifying the macro name as the first token after the start macro
marker.  Alternatively, you may make the invocation explicitly invoke a
defined macro by specifying `INVOKE' (*note INVOKE::) in the macro
invocation.  If you do that, the macro name can be computed with an
expression that gets evaluated every time the INVOKE macro is
encountered.

   Any remaining text in the macro invocation will be used to create new
name/value pairs that only persist for the duration of the processing of
the macro.  The expressions are evaluated the same way basic
expressions are evaluated.  *Note expression syntax::.

   The resulting definitions are handled much like regular definitions,
except:

  1. The values may not be compound.  That is, they may not contain
     nested name/value pairs.

  2. The bindings go away when the macro is complete.

  3. The name/value pairs are separated by whitespace instead of
     semi-colons.

  4. Sequences of strings are not concatenated.

     *NB:* The macro is extracted from the template as the template is
     scanned.  You cannot conditionally define a macro by enclosing it
     in an `IF'/`ENDIF' (*note IF::) macro pair.  If you need to
     dynamically select the format of a `DEFINE'd macro, then put the
     flavors into separate template files that simply define macros.
     `INCLUDE' (*note INCLUDE::) the appropriate template when you have
     computed which you need.

   Due to this, it is acceptable and even a good idea to place all the
`DEFINE' macros at the end of the template.  That puts the main body of
the template at the beginning of the file.

3.6.8 ELIF - Alternate Conditional Template Block
-------------------------------------------------

This macro must only appear after an `IF' function, and before any
associated `ELSE' or `ENDIF' functions.  It denotes the start of an
alternate template block for the `IF' function.  Its expression
argument is evaluated as are the arguments to `IF'.  For a complete
description *Note IF::.

3.6.9 ELSE - Alternate Template Block
-------------------------------------

This macro must only appear after an `IF' function, and before the
associated `ENDIF' function.  It denotes the start of an alternate
template block for the `IF' function.  For a complete description *Note
IF::.

3.6.10 ENDDEF - Ends a macro definition.
----------------------------------------

This macro ends the `DEFINE' function template block.  For a complete
description *Note DEFINE::.

3.6.11 ENDFOR - Terminates the `FOR' function template block
------------------------------------------------------------

This macro ends the `FOR' function template block.  For a complete
description *Note FOR::.

3.6.12 ENDIF - Terminate the `IF' Template Block
------------------------------------------------

This macro ends the `IF' function template block.  For a complete
description *Note IF::.

3.6.13 ENDWHILE - Terminate the `WHILE' Template Block
------------------------------------------------------

This macro ends the `WHILE' function template block.  For a complete
description *Note WHILE::.

3.6.14 ESAC - Terminate the `CASE' Template Block
-------------------------------------------------

This macro ends the `CASE' function template block.  For a complete
description, *Note CASE::.

3.6.15 EXPR - Evaluate and emit an Expression
---------------------------------------------

This macro does not have a name to cause it to be invoked explicitly,
though if a macro starts with one of the apply codes or one of the
simple expression markers, then an expression macro is inferred.  The
result of the expression evaluation (*note expression syntax::) is
written to the current output.

3.6.16 FOR - Emit a template block multiple times
-------------------------------------------------

This macro has a slight variation on the standard syntax:
     FOR <value-name> [ <separator-string> ]

     FOR <value-name> (...Scheme expression list)

     FOR <value-name> IN "string" [ ... ]

   Other than for the last form, the first macro argument must be the
name of an AutoGen value.  If there is no value associated with the
name, the `FOR' template block is skipped entirely.  The scope of the
`FOR' macro extends to the corresponding `ENDFOR' macro.  The last form
will create an array of string values named `<value-name>' that only
exists within the context of this `FOR' loop.  With this form, in order
to use a `separator-string', you must code it into the end of the
template block using the `(last-for?)' predicate function (*note SCM
last-for?::).

   If there are any arguments after the `value-name', the initial
characters are used to determine the form.  If the first character is
either a semi-colon (`;') or an opening parenthesis (`('), then it is
presumed to be a Scheme expression containing the FOR macro specific
functions `for-from', `for-by', `for-to', and/or `for-sep'.  *Note
AutoGen Functions::.  If it consists of an '`i'' an '`n'' and separated
by white space from more text, then the `FOR x IN' form is processed.
Otherwise, the remaining text is presumed to be a string for inserting
between each iteration of the loop.  This string will be emitted one
time less than the number of iterations of the loop.  That is, it is
emitted after each loop, excepting for the last iteration.

   If the from/by/to functions are invoked, they will specify which
copies of the named value are to be processed.  If there is no copy of
the named value associated with a particular index, the `FOR' template
block will be instantiated anyway.  The template must use `found-for?'
(*note SCM found-for?::) or other methods for detecting missing
definitions and emitting default text.  In this fashion, you can insert
entries from a sparse or non-zero based array into a dense, zero based
array.

   *NB:* the `for-from', `for-to', `for-by' and `for-sep' functions are
disabled outside of the context of the `FOR' macro.  Likewise, the
`first-for?', `last-for?' `for-index', and `found-for?' functions are
disabled outside of the range of a `FOR' block.

   *Also:* the `<value-name>' must be a single level name, not a
compound name (*note naming values::).

     [+FOR var (for-from 0) (for-to <number>) (for-sep ",") +]
     ... text with `var'ious substitutions ...[+
     ENDFOR var+]

this will repeat the `... text with `var'ious substitutions ...'
<number>+1 times.  Each repetition, except for the last, will have a
comma `,' after it.

     [+FOR var ",\n" +]
     ... text with `var'ious substitutions ...[+
     ENDFOR var +]

This will do the same thing, but only for the index values of `var'
that have actually been defined.

3.6.17 IF - Conditionally Emit a Template Block
-----------------------------------------------

Conditional block.  Its arguments are evaluated (*note EXPR::) and if
the result is non-zero or a string with one or more bytes, then the
condition is true and the text from that point until a matched `ELIF',
`ELSE' or `ENDIF' is emitted.  `ELIF' introduces a conditional
alternative if the `IF' clause evaluated FALSE and `ELSE' introduces an
unconditional alternative.

     [+IF <full-expression> +]
     emit things that are for the true condition[+

     ELIF <full-expression-2> +]
     emit things that are true maybe[+

     ELSE "This may be a comment" +]
     emit this if all but else fails[+

     ENDIF "This may *also* be a comment" +]

`<full-expression>' may be any expression described in the `EXPR'
expression function, including the use of apply-codes and value-names.
If the expression yields an empty string, it is interpreted as false.

3.6.18 INCLUDE - Read in and emit a template block
--------------------------------------------------

The entire contents of the named file is inserted at this point.  The
contents of the file are processed for macro expansion.  The arguments
are eval-ed, so you may compute the name of the file to be included.
The included file must not contain any incomplete function blocks.
Function blocks are template text beginning with any of the macro
functions `CASE', `DEFINE', `FOR', `IF' and `WHILE'; extending through
their respective terminating macro functions.

3.6.19 INVOKE - Invoke a User Defined Macro
-------------------------------------------

User defined macros may be invoked explicitly or implicitly.  If you
invoke one implicitly, the macro must begin with the name of the
defined macro.  Consequently, this may *not* be a computed value.  If
you explicitly invoke a user defined macro, the macro begins with the
macro name `INVOKE' followed by a basic expression that must yield a
known user defined macro.  A macro name _must_ be found, or AutoGen
will issue a diagnostic and exit.

   Arguments are passed to the invoked macro by name.  The text
following the macro name must consist of a series of names each of
which is followed by an equal sign (`=') and a basic expression that
yields a string.

   The string values may contain template macros that are parsed the
first time the macro is processed and evaluated again every time the
macro is evaluated.

3.6.20 RETURN - Leave an INVOKE-d (DEFINE) macro
------------------------------------------------

This will unwind looping constructs inside of a DEFINE-d macro and
return to the invocation point.  The output files and diversions are
left alone.  This means it is unwise to start diversions in a DEFINEd
macro and RETURN from it before you have handled the diversion.  Unless
you are careful.  Here is some rope for you.  Please be careful using
it.

3.6.21 SELECT - Selection block for CASE function
-------------------------------------------------

This macro selects a block of text by matching an expression against
the sample text expression evaluated in the `CASE' macro.  *Note CASE::.

   You do not specify a `SELECT' macro with the word "select".
Instead, you must use one of the 19 match operators described in the
`CASE' macro description.

3.6.22 UNKNOWN - Either a user macro or a value name.
-----------------------------------------------------

The macro text has started with a name not known to AutoGen.  If, at run
time, it turns out to be the name of a defined macro, then that macro is
invoked.  If it is not, then it is a conditional expression that is
evaluated only if the name is defined at the time the macro is invoked.

   You may not specify `UNKNOWN' explicitly.

3.6.23 WHILE - Conditionally loop over a Template Block
-------------------------------------------------------

Conditionally repeated block.  Its arguments are evaluated (*note
EXPR::) and as long as the result is non-zero or a string with one or
more bytes, then the condition is true and the text from that point
until a matched `ENDWHILE' is emitted.

     [+WHILE <full-expression> +]
     emit things that are for the true condition[+

     ENDWHILE +]

`<full-expression>' may be any expression described in the `EXPR'
expression function, including the use of apply-codes and value-names.
If the expression yields an empty string, it is interpreted as false.

3.6.24 Inserting text from a shell script
-----------------------------------------

If the text between the start and end macro markers starts with an
opening curly brace ('`{'') or is surrounded by back quotes ('``''),
then the text is handed off to the server shell for evaluation.  The
output to standard out is inserted into the document.  If the text
starts with the curly brace, all the text is passed off as is to the
shell.  If surrounded by back quotes, then the string is "cooked"
before being handed off to the shell.

3.6.25 Inserting text from a scheme script
------------------------------------------

If the text between the start and end macro markers starts with a
semi-colon or an opening parenthesis, all the text is handed off to the
Guile/scheme processor.  If the last result is text or a number, it is
added (as text) to the output document.

3.7 Redirecting Output
======================

AutoGen provides a means for redirecting the template output to
different files or, in `M4' parlance, to various diversions.  It is
accomplished by providing a set of Scheme functions named `out-*'
(*note AutoGen Functions::).

`out-push-new (*note SCM out-push-new::)'
     This allows you to logically "push" output files onto a stack.  If
     you supply a string name, then a file by that name is created to
     hold the output.  If you do not supply a name, then the text is
     written to a scratch pad and retrieved by passing a `#t' argument
     to the `out-pop' (*note SCM out-pop::) function.

`out-pop (*note SCM out-pop::)'
     This function closes the current output file and resumes output to
     the next one in the stack.  At least one output must have been
     pushed onto the output stack with the `out-push-new' (*note SCM
     out-push-new::) function.  If `#t' is passed in as an argument,
     then the entire contents of the diversion (or file) is returned.

`out-suspend (*note SCM out-suspend::)'
     This function does not close the current output, but instead sets
     it aside for resumption by the given name with `out-resume'.  The
     current output must have been pushed on the output queue with
     `out-push-new' (*note SCM out-push-new::).

`out-resume (*note SCM out-resume::)'
     This will put a named file descriptor back onto the top of stack
     so that it becomes the current output again.

`out-switch (*note SCM out-switch::)'
     This closes the current output and creates a new file, purging any
     preexisting one.  This is a shortcut for "pop" followed by "push",
     but this can also be done at the base level.

`out-move (*note SCM out-move::)'
     Renames the current output file without closing it.

   There are also several functions for determining the output status.
*Note AutoGen Functions::.

4 Augmenting AutoGen Features
*****************************

AutoGen was designed to be simple to enhance.  You can do it by
providing shell commands, Guile/Scheme macros or callout functions that
can be invoked as a Guile macro.  Here is how you do these.

4.1 Shell Output Commands
=========================

Shell commands are run inside of a server process.  This means that,
unlike `make', context is kept from one command to the next.
Consequently, you can define a shell function in one place inside of
your template and invoke it in another.  You may also store values in
shell variables for later reference.  If you load functions from a file
containing shell functions, they will remain until AutoGen exits.

   If your shell script should determine that AutoGen should stop
processing, the recommended method for stopping AutoGen is:
     die "some error text"

That is a shell function added by AutoGen.  It will send a SIGTERM to
autogen and exit from the "persistent" shell.

4.2 Guile Macros
================

Guile also maintains context from one command to the next.  This means
you may define functions and variables in one place and reference them
elsewhere.  If your Scheme script should determine that AutoGen should
stop processing, the recommended method for stopping AutoGen is:
     (error "some error text")

4.3 Guile Callout Functions
===========================

Callout functions must be registered with Guile to work.  This can be
accomplished either by putting your routines into a shared library that
contains a `void scm_init(void)' routine that registers these routines,
or by building them into AutoGen.

   To build them into AutoGen, you must place your routines in the
source directory and name the files `exp*.c'.  You also must have a
stylized comment that `getdefs' can find that conforms to the following:

     /*=gfunc <function-name>
      *
      *  what:    <short one-liner>
      *  general_use:
      *  string:  <invocation-name-string>
      *  exparg:  <name>, <description> [, ['optional'] [, 'list']]
      *  doc:     A long description telling people how to use
      *           this function.
     =*/
     SCM
     ag_scm_<function-name>( SCM arg_name[, ...] )
     { <code> }

`gfunc'
     You must have this exactly thus.

`<function-name>'
     This must follow C syntax for variable names

`<short one-liner>'
     This should be about a half a line long.  It is used as a
     subsection title in this document.

`general_use:'
     You must supply this unless you are an AutoGen maintainer and are
     writing a function that queries or modifies the state of AutoGen.

`<invocation-name-string>'
     Normally, the FUNCTION-NAME string will be transformed into a
     reasonable invocation name.  However, that is not always true.  If
     the result does not suit your needs, then supply an alternate
     string.

`exparg:'
     You must supply one for each argument to your function.  All
     optional arguments must be last.  The last of the optional
     arguments may be a list, if you choose.

`doc:'
     Please say something meaningful.

`[, ...]'
     Do not actually specify an ANSI ellipsis here.  You must provide
     for all the arguments you specified with EXPARG.

   See the Guile documentation for more details.  More information is
also available in a large comment at the beginning of the
`agen5/snarf.tpl' template file.

4.4 AutoGen Macros
==================

There are two kinds  those you define yourself and AutoGen native.  The
user-defined macros may be defined in your templates, *Note DEFINE::.

   As for AutoGen native macros, do not add any. It is easy to do, but I
won't like it.  The basic functions needed to accomplish looping over
and selecting blocks of text have proved to be sufficient over a period
of several years.  New text transformations can be easily added via any
of the AutoGen extension methods, as discussed above.

5 Invoking autogen
******************

AutoGen creates text files from templates using external definitions.

   `AutoGen' is designed for generating program files that contain
repetitive text with varied substitutions.  The goal is to simplify the
maintenance of programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text.
This is especially valuable if there are several blocks of such text
that must be kept synchronized.

   One common example is the problem of maintaining the code required
for processing program options.  Processing options requires a minimum
of four different constructs be kept in proper order in different places
in your program.  You need at least: The flag character in the flag
string, code to process the flag when it is encountered, a global state
variable or two, and a line in the usage text.  You will need more
things besides this if you choose to implement long option names,
configuration file processing, environment variables and so on.

   All of this can be done mechanically; with the proper templates and
this program.

   This chapter was generated by *AutoGen*, using the `agtexi-cmd'
template and the option descriptions for the `autogen' program.  This
software is released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or
later.

5.1 autogen help/usage (`--help')
=================================

This is the automatically generated usage text for autogen.

   The text printed is the same whether selected with the `help' option
(`--help') or the `more-help' option (`--more-help').  `more-help' will
print the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
`more-help' is disabled on platforms without a working `fork(2)'
function.  The `PAGER' environment variable is used to select the
program, defaulting to `more'.  Both will exit with a status code of 0.

autogen (GNU AutoGen) - The Automated Program Generator - Ver. 5.18.6pre12
Usage:  autogen [ -<flag> [<val>] | --<name>[{=| }<val>] ]... [ <def-file> ]

The following options select definitions, templates and scheme functions
to use:

  Flg Arg Option-Name    Description
   -L Str templ-dirs     Search for templates in DIR
                                - may appear multiple times

   -m no  no-fmemopen    Do not use in-mem streams
      Str equate         characters considered equivalent

The following options modify how output is handled:

  Flg Arg Option-Name    Description
   -b Str base-name      Specify NAME as the base name for output
                                - may not be preset
      no  source-time    set mod times to latest source
                                - disabled as '--no-source-time'
      no  writable       Allow output files to be writable
                                - disabled as '--not-writable'

The following options are often useful while debugging new templates:

  Flg Arg Option-Name    Description
      Num loop-limit     Limit on increment loops
                                - is scalable with a suffix: k/K/m/M/g/G/t/T
                                - it must lie in one of the ranges:
                                  -1 exactly, or
                                  1 to 16777216
   -t Num timeout        Limit server shell operations to SECONDS
                                - it must be in the range:
                                  0 to 3600
      KWd trace          tracing level of detail

                                - may not be preset
   -C no  core           Leave a core dump on a failure exit

These options can be used to control what gets processed in the
definitions files and template files:

  Flg Arg Option-Name    Description
   -s Str skip-suffix    Skip the file with this SUFFIX
                                - prohibits the option 'select-suffix'
                                - may not be preset
                                - may appear multiple times
   -o Str select-suffix  specify this output suffix
                                - may not be preset
                                - may appear multiple times
   -D Str define         name to add to definition list
                                - may appear multiple times
   -U Str undefine       definition list removal pattern
                                - an alternate for 'define'

This option is used to automate dependency tracking:

  Flg Arg Option-Name    Description
   -M opt make-dep       emit make dependency file
                                - may not be preset
                                - may appear multiple times

help, version and option handling:

  Flg Arg Option-Name    Description
   -R Str reset-option   reset an option's state
   -v opt version        output version information and exit
   -? no  help           display extended usage information and exit
   -! no  more-help      extended usage information passed thru pager
   -u no  usage          abbreviated usage to stdout
   -> opt save-opts      save the option state to a config file
   -< Str load-opts      load options from a config file
                                - disabled as '--no-load-opts'
                                - may appear multiple times

Options are specified by doubled hyphens and their name or by a single
hyphen and the flag character.
AutoGen creates text files from templates using external definitions.

The following option preset mechanisms are supported:
 - reading file $HOME
 - reading file ./.autogenrc
 - examining environment variables named AUTOGEN_*

The valid "trace" option keywords are:
  nothing       debug-message server-shell  templates     block-macros
  expressions   everything
  or an integer from 0 through 6

5.2 input-select options
========================

The following options select definitions, templates and scheme
functions to use.

templ-dirs option (-L).
-----------------------

This is the "search for templates in `dir'" option.  This option takes
a string argument `DIR'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   Add a directory to the list of directories `autogen' searches when
opening a template, either as the primary template or an included one.
The last entry has the highest priority in the search list.  That is to
say, they are searched in reverse order.

override-tpl option (-T).
-------------------------

This is the "use `tpl-file' for the template" option.  This option
takes a string argument `TPL-FILE'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   Definition files specify the standard template that is to be
expanded.  This option will override that name and expand a different
template.

lib-template option (-l).
-------------------------

This is the "load autogen macros from `tpl-file'" option.  This option
takes a string argument `TPL-FILE'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   DEFINE macros are saved from this template file for use in processing
the main macro file.  Template text aside from the DEFINE macros is is
ignored.

   Do not use this.  Instead, use the INCLUDE macro in your template.

   *NOTE**: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED*

definitions option.
-------------------

This is the "read definitions from `file'" option.  This option takes a
string argument `FILE'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-definitions.

   * It is enabled by default.

   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   Use this argument to specify the input definitions file with a
command line option.  If you do not specify this option, then there
must be a command line argument that specifies the file, even if only
to specify stdin with a hyphen (`-').  Specify, `--no-definitions' when
you wish to process a template without any active AutoGen definitions.

shell option.
-------------

This is the "name or path name of shell to use" option.  This option
takes a string argument `shell'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must be compiled in by defining `SHELL_ENABLED' during the
     compilation.

   By default, when AutoGen is built, the configuration is probed for a
reasonable Bourne-like shell to use for shell script processing.  If a
particular template needs an alternate shell, it must be specified with
this option on the command line, with an environment variable (`SHELL')
or in the configuration/initialization file.

no-fmemopen option (-m).
------------------------

This is the "do not use in-mem streams" option.  If the local C library
supports "`fopencookie(3GNU)'", or "`funopen(3BSD)'" then AutoGen
prefers to use in-memory stream buffer opens instead of anonymous
files.  This may lead to problems if there is a shortage of virtual
memory.  If, for a particular application, you run out of memory, then
specify this option.  This is unlikely in a modern 64-bit virtual
memory environment.

   On platforms without these functions, the option is accepted but
ignored.  `fmemopen(POSIX)' is not adequate because its string buffer
is not reallocatable.  `open_memstream(POSIX)' is also not adequate
because the stream is only opened for output.  AutoGen needs a
reallocatable buffer available for both reading and writing.

equate option.
--------------

This is the "characters considered equivalent" option.  This option
takes a string argument `char-list'.  This option will alter the list
of characters considered equivalent.  The default are the three
characters, "_-^".  (The last is conventional on a Tandem/HP-NonStop,
and I used to do a lot of work on Tandems.)

5.3 out-handling options
========================

The following options modify how output is handled.

base-name option (-b).
----------------------

This is the "specify `name' as the base name for output" option.  This
option takes a string argument `NAME'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   A template may specify the exact name of the output file.  Normally,
it does not.  Instead, the name is composed of the base name of the
definitions file with suffixes appended.  This option will override the
base name derived from the definitions file name.  This is required if
there is no definitions file and advisable if definitions are being
read from stdin.  If the definitions are being read from standard in,
the base name defaults to `stdin'.  Any leading directory components in
the name will be silently removed.  If you wish the output file to
appear in a particular directory, it is recommended that you "cd" into
that directory first, or use directory names in the format specification
for the output suffix lists, *Note pseudo macro::.

source-time option.
-------------------

This is the "set mod times to latest source" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-source-time.

   If you stamp your output files with the `DNE' macro output, then
your output files will always be different, even if the content has not
really changed.  If you use this option, then the modification time of
the output files will change only if the input files change.  This will
help reduce unneeded builds.

writable option.
----------------

This is the "allow output files to be writable" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -not-writable.

   This option will leave output files writable.  Normally, output
files are read-only.

5.4 debug-tpl options
=====================

The following options are often useful while debugging new templates.
They specify limits that prevent the template from taking overly long
or producing more output than expected.

loop-limit option.
------------------

This is the "limit on increment loops" option.  This option takes a
number argument `lim'.  This option prevents runaway loops.  For
example, if you accidentally specify, "FOR x (for-from 1) (for-to -1)
(for-by 1)", it will take a long time to finish.  If you do have more
than 256 entries in tables, you will need to specify a new limit with
this option.

timeout option (-t).
--------------------

This is the "limit server shell operations to `seconds'" option.  This
option takes a number argument `SECONDS'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must be compiled in by defining `SHELL_ENABLED' during the
     compilation.

   AutoGen works with a shell server process.  Most normal commands will
complete in less than 10 seconds.  If, however, your commands need more
time than this, use this option.

   The valid range is 0 to 3600 seconds (1 hour).  Zero will disable
the server time limit.

trace option.
-------------

This is the "tracing level of detail" option.  This option takes a
keyword argument `level'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * This option takes a keyword as its argument.  The argument sets an
     enumeration value that can be tested by comparing the option value
     macro (OPT_VALUE_TRACE).  The available keywords are:
             nothing       debug-message server-shell
             templates     block-macros  expressions
             everything

     or their numeric equivalent.

   This option will cause AutoGen to display a trace of its template
processing.  There are six levels, each level including messages from
the previous levels:

`nothing'
     Does no tracing at all (default)

`debug-message'
     Print messages from the "DEBUG" AutoGen macro (*note DEBUG::).

`server-shell'
     Traces all input and output to the server shell.  This includes a
     shell "independent" initialization script about 30 lines long.
     Its output is discarded and not inserted into any template.

`templates'
     Traces the invocation of `DEFINE'd macros and `INCLUDE's

`block-macros'
     Traces all block macros.  The above, plus `IF', `FOR', `CASE' and
     `WHILE'.

`expressions'
     Displays the results of expression evaluations.

`everything'
     Displays the invocation of every AutoGen macro, even `TEXT' macros
     (i.e. the text outside of macro quotes).  Additionally, if you
     rebuild the "expr.ini" file with debugging enabled, then all calls
     to AutoGen defined scheme functions will also get logged:
         cd ${top_builddir}/agen5
         DEBUG_ENABLED=true bash bootstrap.dir expr.ini
         make CFLAGS='-g -DDEBUG_ENABLED=1'

     Be aware that you cannot rebuild this source in this way without
     first having installed the `autogen' executable in your search
     path.  Because of this, "expr.ini" is in the distributed source
     list, and not in the dependencies.

trace-out option.
-----------------

This is the "tracing output file or filter" option.  This option takes
a string argument `file'.  The output specified may be a file name, a
file that is appended to, or, if the option argument begins with the
`pipe' operator (`|'), a command that will receive the tracing output
as standard in.  For example, `--traceout='| less'' will run the trace
output through the `less' program.  Appending to a file is specified by
preceding the file name with two greater-than characters (`>>').

show-defs option.
-----------------

This is the "show the definition tree" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must be compiled in by defining `DEBUG_ENABLED' during the
     compilation.

   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   This will print out the complete definition tree before processing
the template.

used-defines option.
--------------------

This is the "show the definitions used" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   This will print out the names of definition values searched for
during the processing of the template, whether actually found or not.
There may be other referenced definitions in a template in portions of
the template not evaluated.  Some of the names listed may be computed
names and others AutoGen macro arguments.  This is not a means for
producing a definitive, all-encompassing list of all and only the
values used from a definition file.  This is intended as an aid to
template documentation only.

core option (-C).
-----------------

This is the "leave a core dump on a failure exit" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must be compiled in by defining `HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H' during the
     compilation.

   Many systems default to a zero sized core limit.  If the system has
the sys/resource.h header and if this option is supplied, then in the
failure exit path, autogen will attempt to set the soft core limit to
whatever the hard core limit is.  If that does not work, then an
administrator must raise the hard core size limit.

5.5 processing options
======================

These options can be used to control what gets processed in the
definitions files and template files.  They specify which outputs and
parts of outputs to produce.

skip-suffix option (-s).
------------------------

This is the "skip the file with this `suffix'" option.  This option
takes a string argument `SUFFIX'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   * must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
     select-suffix.

   Occasionally, it may not be desirable to produce all of the output
files specified in the template.  (For example, only the `.h' header
file, but not the `.c' program text.)  To do this specify
`--skip-suffix=c' on the command line.

select-suffix option (-o).
--------------------------

This is the "specify this output suffix" option.  This option takes a
string argument `SUFFIX'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   If you wish to override the suffix specifications in the template,
you can use one or more copies of this option.  See the suffix
specification in the *note pseudo macro:: section of the info doc.

define option (-D).
-------------------

This is the "name to add to definition list" option.  This option takes
a string argument `value'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   The AutoGen define names are used for the following purposes:

  1. Sections of the AutoGen definitions may be enabled or disabled by
     using C-style #ifdef and #ifndef directives.

  2. When defining a value for a name, you may specify the index for a
     particular value.  That index may be a literal value, a define
     option or a value #define-d in the definitions themselves.

  3. The name of a file may be prefixed with `$NAME/'.  The `$NAME'
     part of the name string will be replaced with the define-d value
     for `NAME'.

  4. When AutoGen is finished loading the definitions, the defined
     values are exported to the environment with, `putenv(3)'.  These
     values can then be used in shell scripts with `${NAME}' references
     and in templates with `(getenv "NAME")'.

  5. While processing a template, you may specify an index to retrieve
     a specific value.  That index may also be a define-d value.

   It is entirely equivalent to place this name in the exported
environment.  Internally, that is what AutoGen actually does with this
option.

undefine option (-U).
---------------------

This is the "definition list removal pattern" option.  This option
takes a string argument `name-pat'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   Similar to 'C', AutoGen uses `#ifdef/#ifndef' preprocessing
directives.  This option will cause the matching names to be removed
from the list of defined values.

5.6 dep-track options
=====================

This option is used to automate dependency tracking.

make-dep option (-M).
---------------------

This is the "emit make dependency file" option.  This option takes an
optional string argument `type'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   * may not be preset with environment variables or configuration
     (rc/ini) files.

   This option behaves fairly closely to the way the `-M' series of
options work with the gcc compiler, except that instead of just
emitting the predecessor dependencies, this also emits the successor
dependencies (output target files).  By default, the output dependency
information will be placed in `<base-name>.d', but may also be
specified with `-MF<file>'.  The time stamp on this file will be
manipulated so that it will be one second older than the oldest primary
output file.

   The target in this dependency file will normally be the dependency
file name, but may also be overridden with `-MT<targ-name>'.  AutoGen
will not alter the contents of that file, but it may create it and it
will adjust the modification time to match the start time.

   *NB:* these second letters are part of the option argument, so `-MF
<file>' must have the space character quoted or omitted, and `-M "F
<file>"' is acceptable because the `F' is part of the option argument.

   `-M' may be followed by any of the letters M, F, P, T, Q, D, or G.
However, only F, Q, T and P are meaningful.  All but F have somewhat
different meanings.  `-MT<name>' is interpreted as meaning `<name>' is
a sentinel file that will depend on all inputs (templates and
definition files) and all the output files will depend on this sentinel
file.  It is suitable for use as a real make target.  Q is treated
identically to T, except dollar characters ('$') are doubled.  P causes
a special clean (clobber) phoney rule to be inserted into the make file
fragment.  An empty rule is always created for building the list of
targets.

   This is the recommended usage:
      -MFwhatever-you-like.dep -MTyour-sentinel-file -MP
   and then in your `Makefile', make the `autogen' rule:
      -include whatever-you-like.dep
      clean_targets += clean-your-sentinel-file

      your-sentinel-file:
          autogen -MT$@ -MF$*.d .....

      local-clean :
          rm -f $(clean_targets)

   The modification time on the dependency file is adjusted to be one
second before the earliest time stamp of any other output file.
Consequently, it is suitable for use as the sentinel file testifying to
the fact the program was successfully run.  (`-include' is the GNU make
way of specifying "include it if it exists".  Your make must support
that feature or your bootstrap process must create the file.)

   All of this may also be specified using the `DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' or
`AUTOGEN_MAKE_DEP' environment variables.  If defined, dependency
information will be output.  If defined with white space free text that
is something other than `true', `false', `yes', `no', `0' or `1', then
the string is taken to be an output file name.  If it contains a string
of white space characters, the first token is as above and the second
token is taken to be the target (sentinel) file as `-MT' in the
paragraphs above.  `DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' will be ignored if there are
multiple sequences of white space characters or if its contents are,
specifically, `false', `no' or `0'.

5.7 presetting/configuring autogen
==================================

Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be preset by
loading values from configuration ("rc" or "ini") files, and values
from environment variables named `AUTOGEN' and `AUTOGEN_<OPTION_NAME>'.
`<OPTION_NAME>' must be one of the options listed above in upper case
and segmented with underscores.  The `AUTOGEN' variable will be
tokenized and parsed like the command line.  The remaining variables
are tested for existence and their values are treated like option
arguments.

`libopts' will search in 2 places for configuration files:
   * $HOME

   * $PWD
   The environment variables `HOME', and `PWD' are expanded and
replaced when `autogen' runs.  For any of these that are plain files,
they are simply processed.  For any that are directories, then a file
named `.autogenrc' is searched for within that directory and processed.

   Configuration files may be in a wide variety of formats.  The basic
format is an option name followed by a value (argument) on the same
line.  Values may be separated from the option name with a colon, equal
sign or simply white space.  Values may be continued across multiple
lines by escaping the newline with a backslash.

   Multiple programs may also share the same initialization file.
Common options are collected at the top, followed by program specific
segments.  The segments are separated by lines like:
    [AUTOGEN]
   or by
    <?program autogen>
   Do not mix these styles within one configuration file.

   Compound values and carefully constructed string values may also be
specified using XML syntax:
    <option-name>
       <sub-opt>...&lt;...&gt;...</sub-opt>
    </option-name>
   yielding an `option-name.sub-opt' string value of
    "...<...>..."
   `AutoOpts' does not track suboptions.  You simply note that it is a
hierarchicly valued option.  `AutoOpts' does provide a means for
searching the associated name/value pair list (see: optionFindValue).

   The command line options relating to configuration and/or usage help
are:

version (-v)
------------

Print the program version to standard out, optionally with licensing
information, then exit 0.  The optional argument specifies how much
licensing detail to provide.  The default is to print just the version.
The licensing infomation may be selected with an option argument.  Only
the first letter of the argument is examined:

`version'
     Only print the version.  This is the default.

`copyright'
     Name the copyright usage licensing terms.

`verbose'
     Print the full copyright usage licensing terms.

usage (-u)
----------

Print abbreviated usage to standard out, then exit 0.

reset-option (-R)
-----------------

Resets the specified option to the compiled-in initial state.  This
will undo anything that may have been set by configuration files.  The
option argument may be either the option flag character or its long
name.

5.8 autogen exit status
=======================

One of the following exit values will be returned:
`0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)'
     Successful program execution.

`1 (EXIT_OPTION_ERROR)'
     The command options were misconfigured.

`2 (EXIT_BAD_TEMPLATE)'
     An error was encountered processing the template.

`3 (EXIT_BAD_DEFINITIONS)'
     The definitions could not be deciphered.

`4 (EXIT_LOAD_ERROR)'
     An error was encountered during the load phase.

`5 (EXIT_FS_ERROR)'
     a file system error stopped the program.

`6 (EXIT_NO_MEM)'
     Insufficient memory to operate.

`128 (EXIT_SIGNAL)'
     `autogen' exited due to catching a signal.  If your template
     includes string formatting, a number argument to a "%s" formatting
     element will trigger a segmentation fault.  Autogen will catch the
     seg fault signal and exit with `AUTOGEN_EXIT_SIGNAL(5)'.
     Alternatively, AutoGen may have been interrupted with a `kill(2)'
     signal.

     Subtract 128 from the actual exit code to detect the signal number.

`66 (EX_NOINPUT)'
     A specified configuration file could not be loaded.

`70 (EX_SOFTWARE)'
     libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report it to
     autogen-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  Thank you.

5.9 autogen Examples
====================

Here is how the man page is produced:
    autogen -Tagman-cmd.tpl -MFman-dep -MTstamp-man opts.def

   This command produced this man page from the AutoGen option
definition file.  It overrides the template specified in `opts.def'
(normally `options.tpl') and uses `agman-cmd.tpl'.  It also sets the
make file dependency output to `man-dep' and the sentinel file (time
stamp file) to `man-stamp'.  The base of the file name is derived from
the defined `prog-name'.

   The texi invocation document is produced via:
    autogen -Tagtexi-cmd.tpl -MFtexi-dep -MTtexi-stamp opts.def

6 Configuring and Installing
****************************

6.1 Configuring AutoGen
=======================

AutoGen is configured and built using Libtool, Automake and Autoconf.
Consequently, you can install it wherever you wish using the `--prefix'
and other options.  To the various configuration options supplied by
these tools, AutoGen adds a few of its own:

`--disable-shell'
     AutoGen is now capable of acting as a CGI forms server, *Note
     AutoGen CGI::.  As such, it will gather its definitions using
     either `GET' or `POST' methods.  All you need to do is have a
     template named `cgi.tpl' handy or specify a different one with a
     command line option.

     However, doing this without disabling the server shell brings
     considerable risk.  If you were to pass user input to a script
     that contained, say, the classic "``rm -rf /`'", you might have a
     problem.  This configuration option will cause shell template
     commands to simply return the command string as the result.  No
     mistakes.  Much safer.  Strongly recommended.  The default is to
     have server shell scripting enabled.

     Disabling the shell will have some build side effects, too.

        * Many of the make check tests will fail, since they assume a
          working server shell.

        * The getdefs and columns programs are not built.  The options
          are distributed as definition files and they cannot be
          expanded with a shell-disabled AutoGen.

        * Similarly, the documentation cannot be regenerated because
          the documentation templates depend on subshell functionality.

`--enable-debug'
     Turning on AutoGen debugging enables very detailed inspection of
     the input definitions and monitoring shell script processing.
     These options are not particularly useful to anyone not directly
     involved in maintaining AutoGen.  If you do choose to enable
     AutoGen debugging, be aware that the usage page was generated
     without these options, so when the build process reaches the
     documentation rebuild, there will be a failure.  `cd' into the
     `agen5' build directory, `make' the `autogen.texi' file and all
     will be well thereafter.

`--with-regex-header'
`--with-header-path'
`--with-regex-lib'
     These three work together to specify how to compile with and link
     to a particular POSIX regular expression library.  The value for
     `--with-regex-header=value' must be the name of the relevant
     header file.  The AutoGen sources will attempt to include that
     source with a `#include <value>' C preprocessing statement.  The
     PATH from the `--with-header-path=path' will be added to
     `CPPFLAGS' as `-Ipath'.  The LIB-SPECS from
     `--with-regex-lib=lib-specs' will be added to `LDFLAGS' without
     any adornment.

6.2 AutoGen as a CGI server
===========================

AutoGen is now capable of acting as a CGI forms server.  It behaves as
a CGI server if the definitions input is from stdin and the environment
variable `REQUEST_METHOD' is defined and set to either "GET" or "POST".
If set to anything else, AutoGen will exit with a failure message.
When set to one of those values, the CGI data will be converted to
AutoGen definitions (*note Definitions File::) and the template named
"`cgi.tpl'" will be processed.

   This works by including the name of the real template to process in
the form data and having the "`cgi.tpl'" template include that template
for processing.  I do this for processing the form
`http://autogen.sourceforge.net/conftest.html'.  The "`cgi.tpl'" looks
approximately like this:

    <? AutoGen5 Template ?>
    <?
    IF (not (exist? "template"))                       ?><?
      form-error                                       ?><?

    ELIF (=* (get "template") "/")                     ?><?
      form-error                                       ?><?

    ELIF (define tpl-file (string-append "cgi-tpl/"
                          (get "template")))
         (access? tpl-file R_OK)                       ?><?
      INCLUDE (. tpl-file)                             ?><?

    ELIF (set! tpl-file (string-append tpl-file ".tpl"))
         (access? tpl-file R_OK)                       ?><?
      INCLUDE (. tpl-file)                             ?><?

    ELSE                                               ?><?
      form-error                                       ?><?
    ENDIF                                              ?>

This forces the template to be found in the "`cgi-tpl/'" directory.
Note also that there is no suffix specified in the pseudo macro (*note
pseudo macro::).  That tells AutoGen to emit the output to `stdout'.

   The output is actually spooled until it is complete so that, in the
case of an error, the output can be discarded and a proper error
message can be written in its stead.

   *Please also note* that it is advisable, _especially_ for network
accessible machines, to configure AutoGen (*note configuring::) with
shell processing disabled (`--disable-shell').  That will make it
impossible for any referenced template to hand data to a subshell for
interpretation.

6.3 Signal Names
================

When AutoGen is first built, it tries to use `psignal(3)',
`sys_siglist', `strsigno(3)' and `strsignal(3)' from the host operating
system.  If your system does not supply these, the AutoGen distribution
will.  However, it will use the distributed mapping and this mapping is
unlikely to match what your system uses.  This can be fixed.  Once you
have installed autogen, the mapping can be rebuilt on the host
operating system.  To do so, you must perform the following steps:

  1. Build and install AutoGen in a place where it will be found in your
     search path.

  2. `cd ${top_srcdir}/compat'

  3. `autogen strsignal.def'

  4. Verify the results by examining the `strsignal.h' file produced.

  5. Re-build and re-install AutoGen.

   If you have any problems or peculiarities that cause this process to
fail on your platform, please send me copies of the header files
containing the signal names and numbers, along with the full path names
of these files.  I will endeavor to fix it.  There is a shell script
inside of `strsignal.def' that tries to hunt down the information.

6.4 Installing AutoGen
======================

There are several files that get installed.  The number depend whether
or not both shared and archive libraries are to be installed.  The
following assumes that everything is installed relative to `$prefix'.
You can, of course, use `configure' to place these files where you wish.

   *NB*  AutoGen does not contain any compiled-in path names.  All
support directories are located via option processing, the environment
variable `HOME' or finding the directory where the executable came from.

   The installed files are:

  1. The executables in `bin' (autogen, getdefs and columns).

  2. The AutoOpts link libraries as `lib/libopts.*'.

  3. An include file in `include/options.h', needed for Automated
     Option Processing (see next chapter).

  4. Several template files and a scheme script in `share/autogen',
     needed for Automated Option Processing (*note AutoOpts::), parsing
     definitions written with scheme syntax (*note Dynamic Text::), the
     templates for producing documentation for your program (*note
     documentation attributes::), autoconf test macros, and AutoFSM.

  5. Info-style help files as `info/autogen.info*'.  These files
     document AutoGen, the option processing library AutoOpts, and
     several add-on components.

  6. The three man pages for the three executables are installed in
     man/man1.

   This program, library and supporting files can be installed with
three commands:

   * <src-dir>/configure [ <configure-options> ]

   * make

   * make install

   However, you may wish to insert `make check' before the `make
install' command.

   If you do perform a `make check' and there are any failures, you
will find the results in `<module>/test/FAILURES'.  Needless to say, I
would be interested in seeing the contents of those files and any
associated messages.  If you choose to go on and analyze one of these
failures, you will need to invoke the test scripts individually.  You
may do so by specifying the test (or list of test) in the TESTS make
variable, thus:

    gmake TESTS=test-name.test check

   I specify `gmake' because most makes will not let you override
internal definitions with command line arguments.  `gmake' does.

   All of the AutoGen tests are written to honor the contents of the
VERBOSE environment variable.  Normally, any commentary generated
during a test run is discarded unless the VERBOSE environment variable
is set.  So, to see what is happening during the test, you might invoke
the following with bash or ksh:

    VERBOSE=1 gmake TESTS="for.test forcomma.test" check

Or equivalently with csh:

    env VERBOSE=1 gmake TESTS="for.test forcomma.test" check

7 Automated Option Processing
*****************************

AutoOpts 41.1 is bundled with AutoGen.  It is a tool that virtually
eliminates the hassle of processing options and keeping man pages, info
docs and usage text up to date.  This package allows you to specify
several program attributes, thousands of option types and many option
attributes.  From this, it then produces all the code necessary to
parse and handle the command line and configuration file options, and
the documentation that should go with your program as well.

   All the features notwithstanding, some applications simply have
well-established command line interfaces.  Even still, those programs
may use the configuration file parsing portion of the library.  See the
"AutoOpts Features" and "Configuration File Format" sections.

7.1 AutoOpts Features
=====================

AutoOpts supports option processing; option state saving; and program
documentation with innumerable features.  Here, we list a few obvious
ones and some important ones, but the full list is really defined by
all the attributes defined in the *note Option Definitions:: section.

  1. POSIX-compliant short (flag) option processing.

  2. GNU-style long options processing.  Long options are recognized
     without case sensitivity, and they may be abbreviated.

  3. Environment variable initializations, *Note environrc::.

  4. Initialization from configuration files (aka RC or INI files), and
     saving the option state back into one, *Note loading rcfile::.

  5. Config files may be partitioned.  One config file may be used by
     several programs by partitioning it with lines containing,
     `[PROGRAM_NAME]' or `<?program-name>', *Note loading rcfile::.

  6. Config files may contain AutoOpts directives.  `<?auto-options
     [[option-text]]>' may be used to set `AutoOpts' option processing
     options.  Viz., GNU usage layout versus `AutoOpts' conventional
     layout, and `misuse-usage' versus `no-misuse-usage', *Note usage
     attributes::.

  7. Options may be marked as `dis-abled' with a disablement prefix.
     Such options may default to either an enabled or a disabled state.
     You may also provide an enablement prefix, too, e.g.,
     `--allow-mumble' and `--prevent-mumble' (*note Common
     Attributes::).

  8. Verify that required options are present between the minimum and
     maximum number of times on the command line.  Verify that
     conflicting options do not appear together.  Verify that options
     requiring the presence of other options are, in fact, used in the
     presence of other options.  See *Note Common Attributes::, and
     *Note Option Conflict Attributes::.

  9. There are several *note automatically supported options: automatic
     options.  They will have short flags if any options have option
     flags and the flags are not suppressed.  The associated flag may
     be altered or suppressed by specifying no value or an alternate
     character for `xxx-value;' in the option definition file.  `xxx'
     is the name of the option below:

    `--help'
    `--more-help'
          These are always available.  `--more-help' will pass the full
          usage text through a pager.

    `--usage'
          This is added to the option list if `usage-opt' is specified.
          It yields the abbreviated usage to `stdout'.

    `--version'
          This is added to the option list if `version = xxx;' is
          specified.

    `--load-opts'
    `--save-opts'
          These are added to the option list if `homerc' is specified.
          Mostly.  If, `disable-save' is specified, then `--save-opts'
          is disabled.

 10. Various forms of main procedures can be added to the output, *Note
     Generated main::.  There are four basic forms:

       a. A program that processes the arguments and writes to standard
          out portable shell commands containing the digested options.

       b. A program that will generate portable shell commands to parse
          the defined options.  The expectation is that this result
          will be copied into a shell script and used there.

       c. A `for-each' main that will invoke a named function once for
          either each non-option argument on the command line or, if
          there are none, then once for each non-blank, non-comment
          input line read from stdin.

       d. A main procedure of your own design.  Its code can be
          supplied in the option description template or by
          incorporating another template.

 11. There are several methods for handling option arguments.
        * nothing (*note OPT_ARG::) option argument strings are
          globally available.

        * user supplied (*note Option Argument Handling::)

        * stack option arguments (*note Option Argument Handling::)

        * integer numbers (*note arg-type number::)

        * true or false valued (*note arg-type boolean::)

        * enumerated list of names (*note arg-type keyword::)

        * an enumeration (membership) set (*note arg-type set
          membership::)

        * a list of name/value pairs (option `subopts') (*note arg-type
          hierarchy::)

        * a time duration or a specific time and date

        * validated file name (*note arg-type file name::)

        * optional option argument (*note arg-optional::)

 12. The generated usage text can be emitted in either AutoOpts
     standard format (maximizing the information about each option), or
     GNU-ish normal form.  The default form is selected by either
     specifying or not specifying the `gnu-usage' attribute (*note
     information attributes::).  This can be overridden by the user
     himself with the `AUTOOPTS_USAGE' environment variable.  If it
     exists and is set to the string `gnu', it will force GNU-ish style
     format; if it is set to the string `autoopts', it will force
     AutoOpts standard format; otherwise, it will have no effect.

 13. The usage text and many other strings are stored in a single
     character array (*note string table functions: SCM
     string-table-new.).  This reduces fixup costs when loading the
     program or library.  The downside is that if GCC detects that any
     of these strings are used in a printf format, you may get the
     warning, `embedded '\0' in format'.  To eliminate the warning, you
     must provide GCC with the `-Wno-format-contains-nul' option.

 14. If you compile with `ENABLE_NLS' defined and `_()' defined to a
     localization function (e.g. `gettext(3GNU)'), then the option
     processing code will be localizable (*note i18n::).  Provided also
     that you do not define the `no-xlate' attribute to _anything_
     (*note presentation attributes::).

     You should also ensure that the `ATTRIBUTE_FORMAT_ARG()' gets
     `#define'-ed to something useful.  There is an autoconf macro
     named `AG_COMPILE_FORMAT_ARG' in `ag_macros.m4' that will set it
     appropriately for you.  If you do not do this, then translated
     formatting strings may trigger GCC compiler warnings.

 15. Provides a callable routine to parse a text string as if it were
     from one of the rc/ini/config files, hereafter referred to as a
     configuration file.

 16. By adding a `doc' and `arg-name' attributes to each option,
     AutoGen will also be able to produce a man page and the `invoking'
     section of a texinfo document.

 17. Intermingled option processing.  AutoOpts options may be
     intermingled with command line operands and options processed with
     other parsing techniques.  This is accomplished by setting the
     `allow-errors' (*note program attributes::) attribute.  When
     processing reaches a point where `optionProcess' (*note
     libopts-optionProcess::) needs to be called again, the current
     option can be set with `RESTART_OPT(n)' (*note RESTART_OPT::)
     before calling `optionProcess'.

     See: *Note library attributes::.

 18. Library suppliers can specify command line options that their
     client programs will accept.  They specify option definitions that
     get `#include'-d into the client option definitions and they
     specify an "anchor" option that has a callback and must be invoked.
     That will give the library access to the option state for their
     options.

 19. library options.  An AutoOpt-ed library may export its options for
     use in an AutoOpt-ed program.  This is done by providing an option
     definition file that client programs `#include' into their own
     option definitions.  See "AutoOpt-ed Library for AutoOpt-ed
     Program" (*note lib and program::) for more details.

7.2 AutoOpts Licensing
======================

When AutoGen is installed, the AutoOpts project is installed with it.
AutoOpts includes various AutoGen templates and a pair of shared
libraries.  These libraries may be used under the terms of version 3 of
the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

   One of these libraries (`libopts') is needed by programs that are
built using AutoOpts generated code.  This library is available as a
separate "tear-off" source tarball.  It is redistributable for use
under either of two licenses: The above mentioned GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the advertising-clause-free BSD license.  Both of
these license terms are incorporated into appropriate COPYING files
included with the `libopts' source tarball.  This source may be
incorporated into your package with the following simple commands:

    rm -rf libopts libopts-*
    gunzip -c `autoopts-config libsrc` | \
       tar -xvf -
    mv libopts-*.*.* libopts

   View the `libopts/README' file for further integration information.

7.3 Developer and User Notes
============================

The formatting of the usage message can be controlled with the use of
the `AUTOOPTS_USAGE' environment variable.  If it contains any of five
possible comma separated values, it will affect `libopts' behavior.
Any extraneous or conflicting data will cause its value to be ignored.

   If the program attributes `long-usage' and `short-usage' have been
specified (*note Usage and Version Info Display: usage attributes.),
these strings are used for displaying full usage and abbreviated usage.
"Full usage" is used when usage is requested, "abbreviated usage" when
a usage error is detected.  If these strings are not provided, the
usage text is computed.

   The `AUTOOPTS_USAGE' environment variable may be set to the comma
and/or white space separated list of the following strings:

`compute'
     Ignore the provision of `long-usage' and `short-usage' attributes,
     and compute the usage strings.  This is useful, for example, if
     you wish to regenerate the basic form of these strings and either
     tweak them or translate them.  The methods used to compute the
     usage text are not suitable for translation.

`gnu'
     The format of the usage text will be displayed in GNU-normal form.
     The default display for `--version' will be to include a note on
     licensing terms.

`autoopts'
     The format of the extended usage will be in AutoOpts' native
     layout.  The default version display will be one line of text with
     the last token the version.  `gnu' and `autoopts' conflict and may
     not be used together.

`no-misuse-usage'
     When an option error is made on the command line, the abbreviated
     usage text will be suppressed.  An error message and the method
     for getting full usage information will be displayed.

`misuse-usage'
     When an option error is made on the command line, the abbreviated
     usage text will be shown.  `misuse-usage' and `no-misuse-usage'
     conflict and may not be used together.

   `misuse-usage' and `autoopts' are the defaults.  These defaults may
be flipped to `no-misuse-usage' and `gnu' by specifying `gnu-usage' and
`no-misuse-usage' program attributes, respectively, in the option
definition file.

Note for developers:

   The templates used to implement AutoOpts depend heavily upon token
pasting.  That mens that if you name an option, `debug', for example,
the generated header will expect to be able to emit `#define' macros
such as this:
    #define DESC(n) (autogenOptions.pOptDesc[INDEX_OPT_## n])
   and expect `DESC(DEBUG)' to expand correctly into
`(autogenOptions.pOptDesc[INDEX_OPT_DEBUG])'.  If `DEBUG' is `#defined'
to something else, then that something else will be in the above
expansion.

   If you discover you are having strange problems like this, you may
wish to use some variation of the `guard-option-names' *Note program
attributes::.

7.4 Quick Start
===============

Since it is generally easier to start with a simple example than it is
to look at the options that AutoGen uses itself, here is a very simple
AutoOpts example.  You can copy this example out of the Info file and
into a source file to try it.  You can then embellish it into what you
really need.  For more extensive examples, you can also examine the help
output and option definitions for the commands `columns', `getdefs' and
`autogen' itself.

   If you are looking for a more extensive example, you may search the
autogen sources for files named `*opts.def'.  `xml2ag' is ridiculous
and `autogen' is very lengthy, but `columns' and `getdefs' are not too
difficult.  The `sharutils' sources are fairly reasonable, too.

7.4.1 Example option requirements
---------------------------------

For our simple example, assume you have a program named `check' that
takes two options:

  1. A list of directories to check over for whatever it is `check'
     does.  You want this option available as a POSIX-style flag option
     and a GNU long option.  You want to allow as many of these as the
     user wishes.

  2. An option to show or not show the definition tree being used.
     Only one occurrence is to be allowed, specifying one or the other.

7.4.2 Example option definitions
--------------------------------

First, specify your program attributes and its options to AutoOpts, as
with the following example.

    AutoGen Definitions options;
    prog-name     = check;
    prog-title    = "Checkout Automated Options";
    long-opts;
    gnu-usage;    /* GNU style preferred to default */

    main = { main-type = shell-process; };

    flag = {
        name      = check-dirs;
        value     = L;        /* flag style option character */
        arg-type  = string;   /* option argument indication  */
        max       = NOLIMIT;  /* occurrence limit (none)     */
        stack-arg;            /* save opt args in a stack    */
        descrip   = "Checkout directory list";
        doc       = 'name of each directory that is to be "checked out".';
    };

    flag = {
        name      = show_defs;
        descrip   = "Show the definition tree";
        disable   = dont;     /* mark as enable/disable type */
                              /* option.  Disable as `dont-' */
        doc       = 'disable, if you do not want to see the tree.';
    };

7.4.3 Build the example options
-------------------------------

This program will produce a program that digests its options and writes
the values as shell script code to stdout.  Run the following short
script to produce this program:
    base=check
    BASE=`echo $base | tr '[a-z-]' '[A-Z_]'`
    cflags="-DTEST_${BASE} `autoopts-config cflags`"
    ldflags="`autoopts-config ldflags`"
    autogen ${base}.def
    cc -o ${base} -g ${cflags} ${base}.c ${ldflags}
    ./${base} --help

7.4.4 Example option help text
------------------------------

Running the build commands yields:


    exit 0

7.4.5 Using the example options
-------------------------------

Normally, however, you would not use the `main' clause.  Instead, the
file would be named something like `checkopt.def', you would compile
`checkopt.c' the usual way, and link the object with the rest of your
program.

   The options are processed by calling `optionProcess' (*note
libopts-optionProcess::):

    main( int argc, char** argv )
    {
      {
        int optct = optionProcess( &checkOptions, argc, argv );
        argc -= optct;
        argv += optct;
      }

   The options are tested and used as in the following fragment.
`ENABLED_OPT' is used instead of `HAVE_OPT' for the `--show-defs'
option because it is an enabled/disabled option type:

      if (  ENABLED_OPT( SHOW_DEFS )
         && HAVE_OPT( CHECK_DIRS )) {
        int    dirct = STACKCT_OPT( CHECK_DIRS );
        char** dirs  = STACKLST_OPT( CHECK_DIRS );
        while (dirct-- > 0) {
          char* dir = *dirs++;
          ...

7.4.6 Example option documentation
----------------------------------

The `doc' clauses are used in the flag stanzas for man pages and texinfo
invoking documentation.  With the definition file described above, the
two following commands will produce the two documentation files
`check.1' and `invoke-check.texi'.  The latter file will be generated
as a chapter, rather than a section or subsection.

    autogen -Tagman-cmd check.def
    autogen -DLEVEL=chapter -Tagtexi-cmd -binvoke-check.texi check.def

The result of which is left as an exercise for the reader.

   A lot of magic happens to make this happen.  The rest of this
chapter will describe the myriad of option attributes supported by
AutoOpts.  However, keep in mind that, in general, you won't need much
more than what was described in this "quick start" section.

7.5 Option Definitions
======================

AutoOpts uses an AutoGen definitions file for the definitions of the
program options and overall configuration attributes.  The complete
list of program and option attributes is quite extensive, so if you are
reading to understand how to use AutoOpts, I recommend reading the
"Quick Start" section (*note Quick Start::) and paying attention to the
following:

  1. `prog-name', `prog-title', and `argument', program attributes,
     *Note program attributes::.

  2. `name' and `descrip' option attributes, *Note Required
     Attributes::.

  3. `value' (flag character) and `min' (occurrence counts) option
     attributes, *Note Common Attributes::.

  4. `arg-type' from the option argument specification section, *Note
     Option Arguments::.

  5. Read the overall how to, *Note Using AutoOpts::.

  6. Highly recommended, but not required, are the several "man" and
     "info" documentation attributes, *Note documentation attributes::.

   Keep in mind that the majority are rarely used and can be safely
ignored.  However, when you have special option processing requirements,
the flexibility is there.

7.5.1 Program Description Attributes
------------------------------------

The following global definitions are used to define attributes of the
entire program.  These generally alter the configuration or global
behavior of the AutoOpts option parser.  The first two are required of
every program.  The third is required if there are to be any left over
arguments (operands) after option processing.  The rest have been
grouped below.  Except as noted, there may be only one copy of each of
these definitions:

`prog-name'
     This attribute is required.  Variable names derived from this name
     are derived using `string->c_name!' (*note SCM string->c-name!::).

`prog-title'
     This attribute is required and may be any descriptive text.

`argument'
     This attribute is required if your program uses operand arguments.
     It specifies the syntax of the arguments that *follow* the options.
     It may not be empty, but if it is not supplied, then option
     processing must consume all the arguments.  If it is supplied and
     starts with an open bracket (`['), then there is no requirement on
     the presence or absence of command line arguments following the
     options.  Lastly, if it is supplied and does not start with an
     open bracket, then option processing must *not* consume all of the
     command line arguments.

`config-header'
     If your build has a configuration header, it must be included
     before anything else.  Specifying the configuration header file
     name with this attribute will cause that to happen.

7.5.1.1 Usage and Version Info Display
......................................

These will affect the way usage is seen and whether or not version
information gets displayed.

`full-usage'
     If this attribute is provided, it may specify the full length
     usage text, or a variable name assignable to a `char const *'
     pointer, or it may be empty.  The meanings are determined by  the
     length.
        * If not provided, the text will be computed as normal.

        * If the length is zero, then the usage text will be derived
          from the current settings and inserted as text into the
          generated .c file.

        * If the length is 1 to 32 bytes, then it is presumed to be a
          variable name that either points to or is an array of const
          chars.

        * If it is longer than that, it is presumed to be the help text
          itself.  This text will be inserted into the generated .c
          file.

     This string should be readily translatable.  Provision will be made
     to translate it if this is provided, if the source code is
     compiled with `ENABLE_NLS' defined, and `no-xlate' has not been
     set to the value _anything_.  The untranslated text will be handed
     to `dgettext("libopts", txt)' and then `gettext(txt)' for
     translation, one paragraph at a time.

     To facilitate the creation and maintenance of this text, you can
     force the string to be ignored and recomputed by specifying
         AUTOOPTS_USAGE=compute
     in the environment and requesting help or usage information.  See
     *Note Developer and User Notes: Caveats.

`short-usage'
     If this attribute is provided, it is used to specify an abbreviated
     version of the usage text.  This text is constructed in the same
     way as the `full-usage', described above.

`gnu-usage'
     AutoOpts normaly displays usage text in a format that provides more
     information than the standard GNU layout, but that also means it is
     not the standard GNU layout.  This attribute changes the default to
     GNU layout, with the `AUTOOPTS_USAGE' environment variable used to
     request `autoopts' layout.  See *Note Developer and User Notes:
     Caveats.

`usage-opt'
     I apologize for too many confusing usages of usage.  This
     attribute specifies that `--usage' and/or `-u' be supported.  The
     help (usage) text displayed will be abbreviated when compared to
     the default help text.

`no-misuse-usage'
     When there is a command line syntax error, by default AutoOpts will
     display the abbreviated usage text, rather than just a one line
     "you goofed it, ask for usage" message.  You can change the default
     behavior for your program by supplying this attribute.  The user
     may override this choice, again, with the `AUTOOPTS_USAGE'
     environment variable.  See *Note Developer and User Notes: Caveats.

`prog-group'
     The version text in the `getopt.tpl' template will include this
     text in parentheses after the program name, when this attribute is
     specified.  For example:
         mumble (stumble) 1.0
     says that the `mumble' program is version 1.0 and is part of the
     `stumble' group of programs.

`usage'
     If your program has some cleanup work that must be done before
     exiting on usage mode issues, or if you have to customize the
     usage message in some way, specify this procedure and it will be
     called instead of the default `optionUsage()' function.  For
     example, if a program is using the curses library and needs to
     invoke the usage display, then you must arrange to call `endwin()'
     before invoking the library function `optionUsage()'.  This can be
     handled by specifying your own usage function, thus:
         void
         my_usage(tOptions * opts, int ex)
         {
             if (curses_window_active)
                 endwin();
             optionUsage(opts, ex);
         }

`version'
     Specifies the program version and activates the VERSION option,
     *Note automatic options::.

7.5.1.2 Program Configuration
.............................

Programs may be "pre-configured" before normal command line options are
processed (See *note Immediate Action Attributes: Immediate Action.).
How configuration files and environment variables are handled get
specified with these attributes.

`disable-load'
`disable-save'
     Indicates that the command line usage of `--load-opts' and/or
     `--save-opts' are disallowed.

`environrc'
     Indicates looking in the environment for values of variables named,
     `PROGRAM_OPTNAME' or `PROGRAM', where `PROGRAM' is the upper cased
     C-NAME of the program and `OPTNAME' is the upper cased C-NAME of a
     specific option.  The contents of the `PROGRAM' variable, if
     found, are tokenized and processed.  The contents of
     `PROGRAM_OPTNAME' environment variables are taken as the option
     argument to the option nameed `--optname'.

`homerc'
     Specifies that option settings may be loaded from and stored into
     configuration files.  Each instance of this attribute is either a
     directory or a file using a specific path, a path based on an
     environment variable or a path relative to installation
     directories.  The method used depends on the name.  If the one
     entry is empty, it enables the loading and storing of settings,
     but no specific files are searched for.  Otherwise, a series of
     configuration files are hunted down and, if found, loaded.

     If the first character of the `homerc' value is not the dollar
     character (`$'), then it is presumed to be a path name based on the
     current directory.  Otherwise, the method depends on the second
     character:

    `$'
          The path is relative to the directory where the executable
          was found.

    `@'
          The path is relative to the package data directory, e.g.
          `/usr/local/share/autogen'.

    `[a-zA-Z]'
          The path is derived from the named environment variable.

     Use as many as you like.  The presence of this attribute activates
     the `--save-opts' and `--load-opts' options.  However, saving into
     a file may be disabled with the `disable-save'.  *Note loading
     rcfile::.  See the `optionMakePath(3AGEN)' man page for
     excruciating details.

`rcfile'
     Specifies the configuration file name.  This is only useful if you
     have provided at least one `homerc' attribute.
         default: .<prog-name>rc

`vendor-opt'
     This option implements the `-W' vendor option command line option.

     For POSIX specified utilities, the options are constrained to the
     options that are specified by POSIX.  Extensions should be handled
     with `-W' command line options, the short flag form.  Long option
     name processing must be disabled.  In fact, the `long-opts'
     attribute must not be provided, and some options must be specified
     without flag values.

     The `-W long-name' is processed by looking up the long option name
     that follows it.  It cannot be a short flag because that would
     conflict with the POSIX flag name space.  It will be processed as
     if long options were accepted and `--long-name' were found on the
     command line.

7.5.1.3 Programming Details
...........................

These attributes affect some of the ways that the option data are used
and made available to the program.

`config-header'
     The contents of this attribute should be just the name of the
     configuration file.  A "#include" naming this file will be
     inserted at the top of the generated header.

`exit-name'
`exit-desc'
     These values should be defined as indexed values, thus:
         exit-name[0] = success;
         exit-desc[0] = 'Successful program execution.';
         exit-name[1] = failure;
         exit-desc[1] = 'The operation failed or command syntax was not valid.';
     By default, all programs have these effectively defined for them.
     They may be overridden by explicitly defining any or all of these
     values.  Additional names and descriptions may be defined.  They
     will cause an enumeration to be emitted, like this one for
     `getdefs':
         typedef enum {
             GETDEFS_EXIT_SUCCESS = 0,
             GETDEFS_EXIT_FAILURE = 1
         } getdefs_exit_code_t;
     which will be augmented by any `exit-name' definitions beyond `1'.

     Some of the generated code will exit non-zero if there is an
     allocation error.  This exit will always be code `1', unless there
     is an exit named `no_mem' or `nomem'.  In that case, that value
     will be used.  Additionally, if there is such a value, and if
     `die-code' is specified, then a function `nomem_err(size_t len,
     char const * what)' will be emitted as an inline function for
     reporting out-of-memory conditions.

`usage-message'
     This attribute will cause two procedures to be added to the code
     file: `usage_message()' and `vusage_message()', with any
     applicable prefix (see `prefix', below).  They are declared in the
     generated header, thus:
         extern void vusage_message(char const * fmt, va_list ap);
         extern void usage_message(char const * fmt, ...);
     These functions print the message to `stderr' and invoke the usage
     function with the exit code set to `1' (`EXIT_FAILURE').

`die-code'
     This tells AutoOpts templates to emit code for `vdie()', `die()',
     `fserr()', and, possibly the `nomem_err()' functions.  The latter
     is emitted if an exit name of `no-mem' or `nomem' is specified.
     If the `die-code' is assigned a text value, then that code will be
     inserted in the `vdie' function immediately before it prints the
     death rattle message.

     The profiles for these functions are:
         extern void vdie( int exit_code, char const * fmt, va_list);
         extern void die(  int exit_code, char const * fmt, ...);
         extern void fserr(int exit_code, char const * op, char const * fname);
         static inline void
         nomem_err(size_t sz, char const * what) {...}

`no-return'
     If `usage-message' or `die-code' are specified, you may also
     specify that the generated functions are marked as "noreturn" with
     this attribute.  If this attribute is not empty, then the
     specified string is used instead of "noreturn".  If "noreturn" has
     not been defined before these functions are declared, then it will
     be "#define"-d to the empty string.  No such protection is made
     for any non-default value.  These functions will be declared
     "extern noreturn void".

`export'
     This string is inserted into the .h interface file.  Generally
     used for global variables or `#include' directives required by
     `flag-code' text and shared with other program text.  Do not
     specify your configuration header (`config.h') in this attribute
     or the `include' attribute, however.  Instead, use
     `config-header', above.

`guard-option-names'
     AutoOpts generates macros that presume that there are no `cpp'
     macros with the same name as the option name.  For example, if you
     have an option named, `--debug', then you must not use `#ifdef
     DEBUG' in your code.  If you specify this attribute, every option
     name will be guarded.  If the name is `#define'-d, then a warning
     will be issued and the name undefined.  If you do not specify this
     and there is a conflict, you will get strange error messages.

     This attribute may be set to any of four recognized states:

        * Not defined.  AutoOpts will behave as described above.

        * Defined, but set to the empty string.  Text will be emitted
          into the header to undefine (`#undef') any conflicting
          preprocessor macros.  The code will include compiler warnings
          (via `#warning').  Some compilers are not ANSI-C-99 compliant
          yet and will error out on those warnings.  You may compile
          with `-DNO_OPTION_NAME_WARNINGS' to silence or mostly silence
          them.

        * Defined and set to the string, `no-warning'.  All of the
          needed `#undef's will be emitted, without any conflict
          checking `#warning' directives emitted.

        * Defined and set to the string, `full-enum'.  The option
          manipulation preprocessor macros will not token paste the
          option names to the index enumeration prefix.  e.g. you will
          need to use `HAVE_OPT(INDEX_OPT_DEBUG)' instead of
          `HAVE_OPT(DEBUG)'.

`include'
     This string is inserted into the .c file.  Generally used for
     global variables required only by `flag-code' program text.

`no-libopts'
     If you are going to handle your option processing with the
     `getopt.tpl' template instead of using libopts, then specify this
     attribute.  It will suppress mention of `--more-help' in the
     generated documentation.  (`getopt_long' does not support
     `--more-help'.)

`prefix'
     This value is inserted into *all* global names.  This will
     disambiguate them if more than one set of options are to be
     compiled into a single program.

7.5.1.4 User Presentation Attributes
....................................

Attributes that affect the user's experience.

`allow-errors'
     The presence of this attribute indicates ignoring any command line
     option errors.  This may also be turned on and off by invoking the
     macros `ERRSKIP_OPTERR' and `ERRSTOP_OPTERR' from the generated
     interface file.

`long-opts'
     Presence indicates GNU-standard long option processing.  Partial
     name matches are accepted, if they are at least two characters
     long and the partial match is unique.  The matching is not case
     sensitive, and the underscore, hyphen and carat characters are all
     equivalent (they match).

     If any options do not have an option value (flag character)
     specified, and least one does specify such a value, then you must
     specify `long-opts'.  If none of your options specify an option
     value (flag character) and you do not specify `long-opts', then
     command line arguments are processed in "named option mode".  This
     means that:

        * Every command line argument must be a long option.

        * The flag markers `-' and `--' are completely optional.

        * The `argument' program attribute is disallowed.

        * One of the options may be specified as the default (as long
          as it has a required option argument).

`no-xlate'
     Modifies when or whether option names get translated.  If provided,
     it must be assigned one of these values:
    `opt-cfg'
          to suppress option name translation for configuration file
          and and environment variable processing.

    `opt'
          to suppress option name translation completely.  The usage
          text will always be translated if `ENABLE_NLS' is defined and
          you have translations for that text.

    `anything'
          Specifies disabling all internationalization support for
          option code, completely.
     See also the various `XLAT' interface entries in the AutoOpts
     Programmatic Interface section (*note AutoOpts API::).

`reorder-args'
     Normally, POSIX compliant commands do not allow for options to be
     interleaved with operands.  If this is necessary for historical
     reasons, there are two approaches available:
        * Allow `optionProcess' to return the index of the operand like
          it normally does and process the operand(s).  When an operand
          is encountered that starts with a hyphen, then set the
          AutoOpts current index with the `RESTART_OPT' macro (see
          *note RESTART_OPT::), and re-invoke `optionProcess'.  This
          will also allow you to process the operands in context.

        * Specify this attribute.  AutoOpts will re-order the command
          arguments so that the operands appear (in the original order)
          at the end of the argument list.  Differing configuration
          state is not possible to detect after all options have been
          processed.

`resettable'
     Specifies that the `--reset-option' command line option is to be
     supported.  This makes it possible to suppress any setting that
     might be found in a configuration file or environment variable.

7.5.2 Options for Library Code
------------------------------

Some libraries provide their own code for processing command line
options, and this may be used by programs that utilize AutoOpts.  You
may also wish to write a library that gets configured with AutoOpts
options and config files.  Such a library may either supply its own
configury routine and process its own options, or it may export its
option descriptions to programs that also use AutoOpts.  This section
will describe how to do all of these different things.

7.5.2.1 AutoOpt-ed Library for AutoOpt-ed Program
.................................................

The library source code must provide an option definition file that
consists of only the attribute `library' and `flag' entries.  The
`library' attribute does not need any associated value, so it will
generally appeary by itself on a line folowed by a semi-colon.  The
first `flag' entry must contain the following attributes:

`name'
     This name is used in the construction of a global pointer of type
     `tOptDesc const*'.  It is always required.

`documentation'
     It tells `AutoOpts' that this option serves no normal purpose.  It
     will be used to add usage clarity and to locate option descriptors
     in the library code.

`descrip'
     This is a string that is inserted in the extended usage display
     before the options specific to the current library.  It is always
     required.

`lib-name'
     This should match the name of the library.  This string is also
     used in the construction of the option descriptor pointer name.
     In the end, it looks like this:
         extern tOptDesc const* <<lib-name>>_<<name>>_optDesc_p;
     and is used in the macros generated for the library's `.h' file.

   In order to compile this `AutoOpts' using library, you must create a
special header that is not used by the client program.  This is
accomplished by creating an option definition file that contains
essentially exactly the following:

    AutoGen definitions options;
    prog-name  = does-not-matter;  // but is always required
    prog-title = 'also does not matter';  // also required
    config-header = 'config.h'; // optional, but common
    library;
    #include library-options-only.def

and nothing else.  AutoGen will produce only the `.h' file.  You may
now compile your library, referencing just this `.h' file.  The macros
it creates will utilize a global variable that will be defined by the
`AutoOpts'-using client program.  That program will need to have the
following `#include' in its option definition file:

    #include library-options-only.def

All the right things will magically happen so that the global variables
named <<LIB-NAME>>_<<NAME>>_OPTDESC_P are initialized correctly.  For
an example, please see the `AutoOpts' test script:
`autoopts/test/library.test'.

7.5.2.2 AutoOpt-ed Library for Regular Program
..............................................

In this case, your library must provide an option processing function
to a calling program.  This is accomplished by setting the
`allow-errors' global option attribute.  Each time your option handling
function is called, you must determine where your scan is to resume and
tell the AutoOpts library by invoking:

    RESTART_OPT(next_arg_index);

and then invoke `not_opt_index = optionProcess(...)'.  The
`not_opt_index' value can be used to set `optind', if that is the
global being used to scan the program argument array.

   In this method, do *NOT* utilize the global `library' attribute.
Your library must specify its options as if it were a complete program.
You may choose to specify an alternate `usage()' function so that usage
for other parts of the option interface may be displayed as well.  See
"Program Information Attributes" (*note information attributes::).

   At the moment, there is no method for calling `optionUsage()' telling
it to produce just the information about the options and not the program
as a whole.  Some later revision after somebody asks.

7.5.2.3 AutoOpt-ed Program Calls Regular Library
................................................

As with providing an `AutoOpt'-ed library to a non-`AutoOpt'-ed
program, you must write the option description file as if you were
writing all the options for the program, but you should specify the
`allow-errors' global option attribute and you will likely want an
alternate `usage()' function (see "Program Information Attributes"
*note information attributes::).  In this case, though, when
`optionProcess()' returns, you need to test to see if there might be
library options.  If there might be, then call the library's exported
routine for handling command line options, set the
next-option-to-process with the `RESTART_OPT()' macro, and recall
`optionProcess()'.  Repeat until done.

7.5.3 Program Information Attributes
------------------------------------

These attributes are used to define how and what information is
displayed to the user of the program.

`copyright'
     The `copyright' is a structured value containing three to five
     values.  If `copyright' is used, then the first three are required.

       1. `date' - the list of applicable dates for the copyright.

       2. `owner' - the name of the copyright holder.

       3. `type' - specifies the type of distribution license.
          AutoOpts/AutoGen supports the text of the GNU Public License
          (`gpl'), the GNU Lesser General Public License with Library
          extensions (`lgpl'), the Modified Free BSD license (`mbsd')
          and a few others.  Other licenses may be specified, but you
          must provide your own license file.  The list of license
          files provided by AutoOpts may be seen by typing:
              ls $(autoopts-config pkgdatadir)/*.lic

       4. `text' - the text of the copyright notice.  This must be
          provided if `type' is set to `NOTE'.

       5. `author' - in case the author name is to appear in the
          documentation and is different from the copyright owner.

       6. `eaddr' - email address for receiving praises and complaints.
          Typically that of the author or copyright holder.

     An example of this might be:
         copyright = {
             date  = "1992-2015";
             owner = "Bruce Korb";
             eaddr = 'bkorb@gnu.org';
             type  = GPL;
         };

`detail'
     This string is added to the usage output when the HELP option is
     selected.

`explain'
     Gives additional information whenever the usage routine is invoked.

`package'
     The name of the package the program belongs to.  This will appear
     parenthetically after the program name in the version and usage
     output, e.g.:  `autogen (GNU autogen) - The Automated Program
     Generator'.

`preserve-case'
     This attribute will not change anything except appearance.
     Normally, the option names are all documented in lower case.
     However, if you specify this attribute, then they will display in
     the case used in their specification.  Command line options will
     still be matched without case sensitivity.  This is useful for
     specifying option names in camel-case.

`prog-desc *and*'
`opts-ptr'
     These define global pointer variables that point to the program
     descriptor and the first option descriptor for a library option.
     This is intended for use by certain libraries that need command
     line and/or initialization file option processing.  These
     definitions have no effect on the option template output, but are
     used for creating a library interface file.  Normally, the first
     "option" for a library will be a documentation option that cannot
     be specified on the command line, but is marked as `settable'.
     The library client program will invoke the `SET_OPTION' macro
     which will invoke a handler function that will finally set these
     global variables.

`usage'
     Optionally names the usage procedure, if the library routine
     `optionUsage()' does not work for you.  If you specify `my_usage'
     as the value of this attribute, for example, you will use a
     procedure by that name for displaying usage.  Of course, you will
     need to provide that procedure and it must conform to this profile:
         void my_usage( tOptions* pOptions, int exitCode )

`gnu-usage'
     Normally, the default format produced by the `optionUsage'
     procedure is AutoOpts Standard.  By specifying this attribute, the
     default format will be GNU-ish style.  Either default may be
     overridden by the user with the `AUTOOPTS_USAGE' environment
     variable.  If it is set to `gnu' or `autoopts', it will alter the
     style appropriately.  This attribute will conflict with the
     `usage' attribute.

`reorder-args'
     Some applications traditionally require that the command operands
     be intermixed with the command options.  In order to handle that,
     the arguments must be reordered.  If you are writing such an
     application, specify this global option.  All of the options (and
     any associated option arguments) will be brought to the beginning
     of the argument list.  New applications should not use this
     feature, if at all possible.  This feature is disabled if
     `POSIXLY_CORRECT' is defined in the environment.

7.5.4 Generating main procedures
--------------------------------

When AutoOpts generates the code to parse the command line options, it
has the ability to produce any of several types of `main()' procedures.
This is done by specifying a global structured value for `main'.  The
values that it contains are dependent on the value set for the one
value it must have: `main-type'.

   The recognized values for `main-type' are `guile', `shell-process',
`shell-parser', `main', `include', `invoke', and `for-each'.

7.5.4.1 guile: main and inner_main procedures
.............................................

When the `main-type' is specified to be `guile', a `main()' procedure
is generated that calls `gh_enter()', providing it with a generated
`inner_main()' to invoke.  If you must perform certain tasks before
calling `gh_enter()', you may specify such code in the value for the `before-guile-boot'
attribute.

   The `inner_main()' procedure itself will process the command line
arguments (by calling `optionProcess()', *note
libopts-optionProcess::), and then either invoke the code specified
with the `guile-main' attribute, or else export the parsed options to
Guile symbols and invoke the `scm_shell()' function from the Guile
library.  This latter will render the program nearly identical to the
stock `guile(1)' program.

7.5.4.2 shell-process: emit Bourne shell results
................................................

This will produce a `main()' procedure that parses the command line
options and emits to `stdout' Bourne shell commands that puts the
option state into environment variables.  This can be used within a
shell script as follows:

    unset OPTION_CT
    eval "`opt_parser \"$@\"`"
    test ${OPTION_CT} -gt 0 && shift ${OPTION_CT}

   If the option parsing code detects an error or a request for usage
or version, it will emit a command to exit with an appropriate exit
code to `stdout'.  This form of `main' will cause all messages,
including requested usage and version information, to be emitted to
`stderr'.  Otherwise, a numeric value for `OPTION_CT' is guaranteed to
be emitted, along with assignments for all the options parsed,
something along the lines of the following will be written to `stdout'
for evaluation:

    OPTION_CT=4
    export OPTION_CT
    MYPROG_SECOND='first'
    export MYPROG_SECOND
    MYPROG_ANOTHER=1 # 0x1
    export MYPROG_ANOTHER

If the arguments are to be reordered, however, then the resulting set
of operands will be emitted and `OPTION_CT' will be set to zero.  For
example, the following would be appended to the above:

    set -- 'operand1' 'operand2' 'operand3'
    OPTION_CT=0

`OPTION_CT' is set to zero since it is not necessary to shift off any
options.

7.5.4.3 shell-parser: emit Bourne shell script
..............................................

This will produce a `main()' procedure that emits a shell script that
will parse the command line options.  That script can be emitted to
`stdout' or inserted or substituted into a pre-existing shell script
file.  Improbable markers are used to identify previously inserted
parsing text:

    # # # # # # # # # # -- do not modify this marker --

The program is also pretty insistent upon starting its parsing script
on the second line.

7.5.4.4 main: user supplied main procedure
..........................................

You must supply a value for the `main-text' attribute.  You may also
supply a value for `option-code'.  If you do, then the `optionProcess'
invocation will not be emitted into the code.  AutoOpts will wrap the
`main-text' inside of:

    int
    main( int argc, char** argv )
    {
        int res = <<success-exit-code>>;
        { // replaced by option-code, if that exists
            int ct = optionProcess( &<<prog-name>>Options, argc, argv);
            argc -= ct;
            argv += ct;
        }
    <<main-text>>
        return res;
    }

so you can most conveniently set the value with a `here string' (*note
here-string::):

    code = <<- _EndOfMainProc_
    	<<your text goes here>>
    	_EndOfMainProc_;

7.5.4.5 include: code emitted from included template
....................................................

You must write a template to produce your main procedure.  You specify
the name of the template with the `tpl' attribute and it will be
incorporated at the point where AutoOpts is ready to emit the `main()'
procedure.

   This can be very useful if, in your working environment, you have
many programs with highly similar `main()' procedures.  All you need to
do is parameterize the variations and specify which variant is needed
within the `main' AutoOpts specification.  Since you are coding the
template for this, the attributes needed for this variation would be
dictated by your template.

   Here is an example of an `include' variation:

    main = {
      main-type = include;
      tpl       = "main-template.tpl";
    };

7.5.4.6 invoke: code emitted from AutoGen macro
...............................................

You must write a template to produce your main procedure.  That template
must contain a definition for the function specified with the `func'
attribute to this `main()' procedure specification.  This variation
operates in much the same way as `include' (*note main include::)
method.

7.5.4.7 for-each: perform function on each operand
..................................................

This produces a main procedure that invokes a procedure once for each
operand on the command line (non-option arguments), *OR* once for each
non-blank, non-comment `stdin' input line.  Leading and trailing white
space is trimmed from the input line and comment lines are lines that
are empty or begin with a comment character, defaulting to a hash ('#')
character.

   *NB*: The `argument' program attribute (*note program attributes::)
must begin with the `[' character, to indicate that there are command
operands, but that they are optional.

For an example of the produced main procedure, in the `autoopts/test'
build directory, type the following command and look at `main.c':
    make verbose TESTS=main.test

procedure to handle each argument
.................................

The `handler-proc' attribute is required.  It is used to name the
procedure to call.  That procedure is presumed to be external, but if
you provide the code for it, then the procedure is emitted as a static
procedure in the generated code.

   This procedure should return 0 on success, a cumulative error code
on warning and exit without returning on an unrecoverable error.  As
the cumulative warning codes are or-ed together, the codes should be
some sort of bit mask in order to be ultimately decipherable (if you
need to do that).

   If the called procedure needs to cause a fail-exit, it is expected
to call `exit(3)' directly.  If you want to cause a warning exit code,
then this handler function should return a non-zero status.  That value
will be *OR*-ed into a result integer for computing the final exit
code.  E.g., here is part of the emitted code:

      int res = 0;
      if (argc > 0) {
         do  {
             res |= MY_HANDLER( *(argv++) );
         } while (--argc > 0);
      } else { ...

handler procedure type
......................

If you do not supply the `handler-type' attribute, your handler
procedure must be the default type.  The profile of the procedure must
be:

    int MY_HANDLER(char const * pz_entry);

However, if you do supply this attribute, you may set the value to any
of four alternate flavors:

`name-of-file'
     This is essentially the same as the default handler type, except
     that before your procedure is invoked, the generated code has
     verified that the string names an existing file.  The profile is
     unchanged.

`file-X'
     Before calling your procedure, the file is f-opened according to
     the `X', where `X' may be any of the legal modes for `fopen(3C)'.
     In this case, the profile for your procedure must be:

         int MY_HANDLER(char const * pz_fname, FILE * entry_fp);

     When processing inputs as file pointer stream files, there are
     several ways of treating standard input.  It may be an ordinary
     input file, or it may contain a list of files to operate on.

     If the file handler type is more specifically set to `file-r' and
     a command line operand consists of a single hyphen, then MY_HANDLER
     will be called with `entry_fp' set to `stdin' and the `pz_fname'
     set to the translatable string, "standard input".  Consequently,
     in this case, if the input list is being read from `stdin', a line
     containing a hyphen by itself will be ignored.

`stdin-input'
     This attribute specifies that standard input is a data input file.
     By default, `for-each' main procedures will read standard input for
     operands if no operands appear on the command line.  If there are
     operands after the command line options, then standard input is
     typically ignored.  It can always be processed as an input data
     file, however, if a single bare hyphen is put on the command line.

`text-of-file'
`some-text-of-file'
     Before calling your procedure, the contents of the file are read
     or mapped into memory.  (Excessively large files may cause
     problems.)  The `some-text-of-file' disallows empty files.  Both
     require regular files.  In this case, the profile for your
     procedure must be:

         program_exit_code_t
         MY_HANDLER(char const * fname, char * file_text,
                    size_t text_size);

     Note that though the `file_text' is not `const', any changes made
     to it are not written back to the original file.  It is merely a
     memory image of the file contents.  Also, the memory allocated to
     hold the text is `text_size + 1' bytes long and the final byte is
     always `NUL'.  The file contents need not be text, as the data are
     read with the `read(2)' system call.

     `file_text' is automatically freed, unless you specify a `handler-frees'
     attribute.  Then your code must `free(3)' the text.

   If you select one of these file type handlers, then on access or
usage errors the `PROGRAM_EXIT_FAILURE' exit code will, by default, be
or-ed into the final exit code.  This can be changed by specifying the
global `file-fail-code' attribute and naming a different value.  That
is, something other than `failure'.  You may choose `success', in which
case file access issues will not affect the exit code and the error
message will not be printed.

code for handler procedure
..........................

With the `MYHANDLER-code' attribute, you provide the code for your
handler procedure in the option definition file.  Note that the
spelling of this attribute depends on the name provided with the
`handler-proc' attribute, so we represent it here with `MYHANDLER' as a
place holder.  As an example, your `main()' procedure specification
might look something like this:

    main = {
      main-type    = for-each;
      handler-proc = MYHANDLER;
      MYHANDLER-code = <<- EndOfMyCode
    	/* whatever you want to do */
    	EndOfMyCode;
    };

and instead of an emitted external reference, a procedure will be
emitted that looks like this:

    static int
    MYHANDLER( char const* pz_entry )
    {
        int res = 0;
        <<MYHANDLER-code goes here>>
        return res;
    }

for-each main procedure options
...............................

These attributes affect the main procedure and how it processes each
argument or input line.

`interleaved'
     If this attribute is specified, then options and operands may be
     interleaved.  Arguments or input lines beginning with a hyphen will
     cause it to be passed through to an option processing function and
     will take effect for the remainder of the operands (or input lines)
     processed.

`main-init'
     This is code that gets inserted after the options have been
     processed, but before the handler procs get invoked.

`main-fini'
     This is code that gets inserted after all the entries have been
     processed, just before returning from `main()'.

`comment-char'
     When reading operands from standard input, if you wish comment
     lines to start with a character other than a hash (`#') character,
     then specify one character with this attribute.  If string value
     is empty, then only blank lines will be considered comments.

7.5.5 Option Attributes
-----------------------

For each option you wish to specify, you must have a block macro named
`flag' defined.  There are two required attributes: `name' and
`descrip'.  If any options do not have a `value' (traditional flag
character) attribute, then the `long-opts' program attribute must also
be defined.  As a special exception, if no options have a `value' *and*
`long-opts' is not defined *and* `argument' is not defined, then all
arguments to the program are named options.  In this case, the `-' and
`--' command line option markers are optional.

7.5.5.1 Required Attributes
...........................

Every option must have exactly one copy of both of these attributes.

`name'
     Long name for the option.  Even if you are not accepting long
     options and are only accepting flags, it must be provided.
     AutoOpts generates private, named storage that requires this name.
     This name also causes a `#define'-d name to be emitted.  It must
     not conflict with any other names you may be using in your program.

     For example, if your option name is, `debug' or `munged-up', you
     must not use the `#define' names `DEBUG' (or `MUNGED_UP') in your
     program for non-AutoOpts related purposes.  They are now used by
     AutoOpts.

     Sometimes (most especially under Windows), you may get a surprise.
     For example, `INTERFACE' is apparently a user space name that one
     should be free to use.  Windows usurps this name.  To solve this,
     you must do one of the following:

       1. Change the name of your option

       2. add the program attribute (*note program attributes::):

              export = '#undef INTERFACE';

       3. add the program attribute:

              guard-option-names;

`descrip'
     Except for documentation options, a *very* brief description of the
     option.  About 40 characters on one line, maximum, not counting
     any texinfo markups.  Texinfo markups are stripped before printing
     in the usage text.  It appears on the `usage()' output next to the
     option name.

     If, however, the option is a documentation option, it will appear
     on one or more lines by itself.  It is thus used to visually
     separate and comment upon groups of options in the usage text.

7.5.5.2 Common Option Attributes
................................

These option attributes are optional.  Any that do appear in the
definition of a flag, may appear only once.

`value'
     The flag character to specify for traditional option flags, e.g.,
     `-L'.

`max'
     Maximum occurrence count (invalid if DISABLE present).  The
     default maximum is 1.  `NOLIMIT' can be used for the value,
     otherwise it must be a number or a `#define' that evaluates to a
     number.

`min'
     Minimum occurrence count.  If present, then the option *must*
     appear on the command line.  Do not define it with the value zero
     (0).

`must-set'
     If an option must be specified, but it need not be specified on
     the command line, then specify this attribute for the option.

`deprecated'
     There are two effects to this attribute:  the usage text will not
     show the option, and the generated documentation will mark it with:
     _NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED_.

`disable'
     Prefix for disabling (inverting sense of) the option.  Only useful
     if long option names are being processed.  When an option has this
     attribute, the test `ENABLED_OPT(OPTNAME)' is false when either of
     the following is true:
        * The option has not been specified and the `enable' attribute
          has not been specified.

        * The option has been specified with this disabling prefix.
     To detect that the option has been specified with the disabling
     prefix, you must use:
         HAVE_OPT(OPTNAME) && ! ENABLED_OPT(OPTNAME)

`enable'
     Long-name prefix for enabling the option (invalid if DISABLE *not*
     present).  Only useful if long option names are being processed.

`enabled'
     If default is for option being enabled.  (Otherwise, the
     OPTST_DISABLED bit is set at compile time.)  Only useful if the
     option can be disabled.

`ifdef'
`ifndef'
`omitted-usage'
     If an option is relevant on certain platforms or when certain
     features are enabled or disabled, you can specify the compile time
     flag used to indicate when the option should be compiled in or
     out.  For example, if you have a configurable feature, `mumble'
     that is indicated with the compile time define, `WITH_MUMBLING',
     then add:

         ifdef = WITH_MUMBLING;

     Take care when using these.  There are several caveats:

        * The case and spelling must match whatever is specified.

        * Do not confuse these attributes with the AutoGen directives
          of the same names, *Note Directives::.  These cause C
          preprocessing directives to be inserted into the generated C
          text.

        * Only one of `ifdef' and `ifndef' may apply to any one option.

        * The `VALUE_OPT_' values are `#define'-d.  If `WITH_MUMBLING'
          is not defined, then the associated `VALUE_OPT_' value will
          not be `#define'-d either.  So, if you have an option named,
          `MUMBLING' that is active only if `WITH_MUMBLING' is
          `#define'-d, then `VALUE_OPT_MUMBLING' will be `#define'-d
          iff `WITH_MUMBLING' is `#define'-d.  Watch those switch
          statements.

        * If you specify `omitted-usage', then the option will be
          recognized as disabled when it is configured out of the
          build, but will yield the message, "This option has been
          disabled."  You may specify an alternate message by giving
          `omitted-usage' a string value. e.g.:
              omitted-usage = 'you cannot do this';

`no-command'
     This option specifies that the option is not allowed on the
     command line.  Such an option may not take a `value' (flag
     character) attribute.  The program must have the `homerc' (*note
     program attributes::) option set.

7.5.5.3 Immediate Action Attributes
...................................

Certain options may need to be processed early.  For example, in order
to suppress the processing of configuration files, it is necessary to
process the command line option `--no-load-opts' *before* the config
files are processed.  To accommodate this, certain options may have
their enabled or disabled forms marked for immediate processing.  The
consequence of this is that they are processed ahead of all other
options in the reverse of normal order.

   Normally, the first options processed are the options specified in
the first `homerc' file, followed by then next `homerc' file through to
the end of config file processing.  Next, environment variables are
processed and finally, the command line options.  The later options
override settings processed earlier.  That actually gives them higher
priority.  Command line immediate action options actually have the
lowest priority of all.  They would be used only if they are to have an
effect on the processing of subsequent options.

`immediate'
     Use this option attribute to specify that the enabled form of the
     option is to be processed immediately.  The `help' and `more-help'
     options are so specified.  They will also call `exit()' upon
     completion, so they *do* have an effect on the processing of the
     remaining options :-).

`immed-disable'
     Use this option attribute to specify that the disabled form of the
     option is to be processed immediately.  The `load-opts' option is
     so specified.  The `--no-load-opts' command line option will
     suppress the processing of config files and environment variables.
     Contrariwise, the `--load-opts' command line option is processed
     normally.  That means that the options specified in that file will
     be processed after all the `homerc' files and, in fact, after
     options that precede it on the command line.

`also'
     If either the `immediate' or the `immed-disable' attributes are
     set to the string, `also', then the option will actually be
     processed twice:  first at the immediate processing phase and again
     at the normal time.

7.5.5.4 Option Conflict Attributes
..................................

These attributes may be used as many times as you need.  They are used
at the end of the option processing to verify that the context within
which each option is found does not conflict with the presence or
absence of other options.

   This is not a complete cover of all possible conflicts and
requirements, but it simple to implement and covers the more common
situations.

`flags-must'
     one entry for every option that *must* be present when this option
     is present

`flags-cant'
     one entry for every option that *cannot* be present when this
     option is present

7.5.5.5 Program may set option
..............................

If the option can be set outside of option processing, specify
`settable'.  If this attribute is defined, special macros for setting
this particular option will be inserted into the interface file.  For
example, `TEMPL_DIRS' is a settable option for AutoGen, so a macro named
`SET_OPT_TEMPL_DIRS(a)' appears in the interface file.  This attribute
interacts with the DOCUMENTATION attribute.

7.5.5.6 Option cannot be pre-configured
.......................................

If presetting this option is not allowed, specify `no-preset'.  (Thus,
environment variables and values set in configuration files will be
ignored.)

7.5.5.7 Option Equivalence Class
................................

Generally, when several options are mutually exclusive and basically
serve the purpose of selecting one of several processing modes, specify
the `equivalence' attribute.  These options will be considered an
equivalence class.  Sometimes, it is just easier to deal with them as
such.  All members of the equivalence class must contain the same
equivalenced-to option, including the equivalenced-to option itself.
Thus, it must be a class member.

   For an option equivalence class, there is a single occurrence
counter for the class.  It can be referenced with the interface macro,
`COUNT_OPT(BASE_OPTION)', where BASE_OPTION is the equivalenced-to
option name.

   Also, please take careful note: since the options are mapped to the
equivalenced-to option descriptor, any option argument values are
mapped to that descriptor also.  Be sure you know which "equivalent
option" was selected before getting an option argument value!

   During the presetting phase of option processing (*note Presetting
Options::), equivalenced options may be specified.  However, if
different equivalenced members are specified, only the last instance
will be recognized and the others will be discarded.  A conflict error
is indicated only when multiple different members appear on the command
line itself.

   As an example of where equivalenced options might be useful,
`cpio(1)' has three options `-o', `-i', and `-p' that define the
operational mode of the program (`create', `extract' and
`pass-through', respectively).  They form an equivalence class from
which one and only one member must appear on the command line.  If
`cpio' were an AutoOpt-ed program, then each of these option
definitions would contain:

    equivalence = create;

   and the program would be able to determine the operating mode with
code that worked something like this:

    switch (WHICH_IDX_CREATE) {
    case INDEX_OPT_CREATE:       ...
    case INDEX_OPT_EXTRACT:      ...
    case INDEX_OPT_PASS_THROUGH: ...
    default:    /* cannot happen */
    }

7.5.5.8 Option Aliasing
.......................

Sometimes, for backwards compatibility or tradition or just plain
convenience, it works better to define one option as a pure alias for
another option.  For such situations, provide the following pieces of
information:
    flag = {
       name  = aliasing-option-name;
       value = aliasing-flag-char; // optional !
       aliases = aliased-to-option;
    };
   Do not provide anything else.  The usage text for such an option
will be:
       This is an alias for aliased-to-option

7.5.5.9 Default Option
......................

If your program processes its arguments in named option mode (See
`long-opts' in *note program attributes::), then you may select *one*
of your options to be the default option.  Do so by using attribute
`default' with one of the options.  The option so specified must have
an `arg-type' (*note Option Arguments::) specified, but not the
`arg-optional' (*note arg-optional::) attribute.  That is to say, the
option argument must be required.

   If you have done this, then any arguments that do not match an
option name and do not contain an equal sign (`=') will be interpreted
as an option argument to the default option.

7.5.5.10 Option Sectioning Comment
..................................

This attribute means the option exists for the purpose of separating
option description text in the usage output and texi documentation.
Without this attribute, every option is a separate node in the texi
docs.  With this attribute, the documentation options become texi doc
nodes and the options are collected under them.  Choose the name
attribute carefully because it will appear in the texi documentation.

   Libraries may also choose to make it settable so that the library can
determine which command line option is the first one that pertains to
the library.

   If the `documentation' attribute is present, then all other
attributes are disabled except `settable', `call-proc' and `flag-code'.
`settable' must be and is only specified if `call-proc', `extract-code'
or `flag-code' has been specified.  When present, the `descrip'
attribute will be displayed only when the `--help' option has been
specified.  It will be displayed flush to the left hand margin and may
consist of one or more lines of text, filled to 72 columns.

   The name of the option will not be printed in the help text.  It
will, however, be printed as section headers in the texi documentation.
If the attribute is given a non-empty value, this text will be
reproduced in the man page and texi doc immediately after the `descrip'
text.

7.5.5.11 Translator Notes
.........................

If you need to give the translators a special note about a particular
option, please use the `translators' attribute.  The attribute text
will be emitted into the generated `.c' text where the option related
strings get defined.  To make a general comment about all of the option
code, add comments to an `include' attribute (*note program
attributes::).  Do *not* use this attribute globally, or it will get
emitted into every option definition block.

7.5.6 Option Argument Specification
-----------------------------------

Command line options come in three flavors:  options that do not take
arguments, those that do and those that may.  Without an "arg-type"
attribute, AutoOpts will not process an argument to an option.  If
"arg-type" is specified and "arg-optional" is also specified, then the
next command line token will be taken to be an argument, unless it
looks like the name of another option.

   If the argument type is specified to be anything other than
"str[ing]", then AutoOpts will specify a callback procedure to handle
the argument.  Some of these procedures will be created and inserted
into the generated `.c' file, and others are already built into the
`libopts' library.  Therefore, if you write your own callback procedure
(*note Option Argument Handling::), then you must either not specify an
"arg-type" attribute, or else specify it to be of type "str[ing]".  Your
callback function will be able to place its own restrictions on what
that string may contain or represent.

   Option argument handling attributes depend upon the value set for the `arg-type'
attribute.  It specifies the type of argument the option will take.  If
not present, the option cannot take an argument.  If present, it must
be an entry in the following table.  The first three letters is
sufficient.

7.5.6.1 Arg Type String
.......................

`arg-type = string;'

   The argument may be any arbitrary string, though your program or
option callback procedure may place additional constraints upon it.

7.5.6.2 Arg Type Number
.......................

`arg-type = number;'

   The argument must be a correctly formed integer, without any
trailing U's or L's.  AutoOpts contains a library procedure to convert
the string to a number.  If you specify range checking with `arg-range'
(see below), then AutoOpts produces a special purpose procedure for
this option.

`scaled'
     `scaled' marks the option so that suffixes of `k', `K', `m', `M',
     `g', `G', `t', and `T' will multiply the given number by a power
     of 1000 or 1024.  Lower case letters scale by a power of 1000 and
     upper case scale by a power of 1024.

`arg-range'
     `arg-range' is used to create a callback procedure for validating
     the range of the option argument.  It must match one of the range
     entries.  Each `arg-range' should consist of either an integer by
     itself or an integer range.  The integer range is specified by one
     or two integers separated by the two character sequence, `->'.  Be
     sure to quote the entire range string.  The definitions parser
     will not accept the range syntax as a single string token.

     The generated procedure imposes the range constraints as follows:
        * A number by itself will match that one value.

        * The high end of the range may not be `INT_MIN', both for
          obvious reasons and because that value is used to indicate a
          single-valued match.

        * An omitted lower value implies a lower bound of INT_MIN.

        * An omitted upper value implies a upper bound of INT_MAX.

        * The argument value is required.  It may not be optional.

        * The value must match one of the entries.  If it can match
          more than one, then you have redundancies, but no harm will
          come of it.

7.5.6.3 Arg Type Boolean
........................

`arg-type = boolean;'

   The argument will be interpreted and always yield either AG_TRUE or
AG_FALSE.  False values are  the empty string, the number zero, or a
string that starts with `f', `F', `n' or `N' (representing False or
No).  Anything else will be interpreted as True.

7.5.6.4 Arg Type Keyword
........................

`arg-type = keyword;'

   The argument must match a specified list of strings (*note
arg-keyword::).  Assuming you have named the option, `optn-name', the
strings will be converted into an enumeration of type `te_Optn_Name'
with the values `OPTN_NAME_KEYWORD'.*  If you have *not* specified a
default value, the value `OPTN_NAME_UNDEFINED' will be inserted with
the value zero.  The option will be initialized to that value.  You may
now use this in your code as follows:

    te_Optn_Name opt = OPT_VALUE_OPTN_NAME;
    switch (opt) {
    case OPTN_NAME_UNDEFINED:  /* undefined things */ break;
    case OPTN_NAME_KEYWORD:    /* `keyword' things */ break;
    default: /* utterly impossible */ ;
    }

   AutoOpts produces a special purpose procedure for this option.  You
may not specify an alternate handling procedure.

   If you have need for the string name of the selected keyword, you
may obtain this with the macro, `OPT_OPTN_NAME_VAL2STR(val)'.  The
value you pass would normally be `OPT_VALUE_OPTN_NAME', but anything
with numeric value that is legal for `te_Optn_Name' may be passed.
Anything out of range will result in the string, `"*INVALID*"' being
returned.  The strings are read only.  It may be used as in:

    te_Optn_Name opt = OPT_VALUE_OPTN_NAME;
    printf( "you selected the %s keyword\n",
            OPT_OPTN_NAME_VAL2STR(opt) );

   * Note: you may replace the `OPTN_NAME' enumeration prefix with
another prefix by specifying a `prefix-enum' attribute.

   Finally, users may specify the argument either by name or by number.
Since the numeric equivalents change by having new entries inserted
into the keyword list, this would not be a recommended practice.
However, either `-1' or `~0' will always be equivalent to specifying
the last keyword.

7.5.6.5 Arg Type Set Membership
...............................

`arg-type = set;'

   The argument must be a list of names each of which must match the
strings "`all'", "`none'" or one of the keywords (*note arg-keyword::)
specified for this option.  `all' will turn on all membership bits and
`none' will turn them all off.  Specifying one of the keywords will set
the corresponding set membership bit on (or off, if negated) .  Literal
numbers may also be used and may, thereby, set or clear more than one
bit.

   The membership result starts with the previous (or initialized)
result.  To clear previous results, either start the membership string
with `none +' or with the equals character (`=').  To invert (bit flip)
the final result (regardless of whether the previous result is carried
over or not), start the string with a carat character (`^').  If you
wish to invert the result and start without a carried over value, use
one of the following: `=^' or `^none+'.  These are equivalent.

   The list of names or numbers must be separated by one of the
following characters: `+-|!,' or whitespace.  The comma is equivalent to
whitespace, except that only one may appear between two entries and it
may not appear in conjunction with the OR bar (`|').  The `+|' leading
characters or unadorned name signify adding the next named bit to the
mask, and the `-!'  leading characters indicate removing it.

   The number of keywords allowed is constrained by the number of bits
in a pointer, as the bit set is kept in a `void *' pointer.

   If, for example, you specified `first' in your list of keywords,
then you can use the following code to test to see if either `first' or
`all' was specified:

    uintptr_t opt = OPT_VALUE_OPTN_NAME;
    if (opt & OPTN_NAME_FIRST)
        /* OPTN_NAME_FIRST bit was set */ ;

   AutoOpts produces a special purpose procedure for this option.  To
set multiple bits as the default (initial) value, you must specify an
initial numeric value (which might become inaccurate over time), or
else specify `arg-default' multiple times.  Do not specify a series of
names conjoined with `+' symbols as the value for any of the
`arg-default' attributes.  That works for option parsing, but not for
the option code generation.

7.5.6.6 Arg Type Hierarchical
.............................

`arg-type = hierarchy;'
`arg-type = nested;'

   This denotes an option with a structure-valued argument, a.k.a.
`subopts' in `getopts' terminology.  The argument is parsed and the
values made available to the program via the find and find next calls
(*Note libopts-optionFindValue::, *Note libopts-optionGetValue::, and
*note libopts-optionFindNextValue::).

    tOptionValue * val = optionGetValue(VALUE_OPT_OPTN_NAME, "name");
    while (val != NULL) {
      process(val);
      val = optionNextValue(VALUE_OPT_OPTN_NAME, val);
      if (wrong_name(val, "name"))
        break;
    }

7.5.6.7 Arg Type File Name
..........................

`arg-type = file;'

   This argument type will have some validations on the argument and,
optionally, actually open the file.  You must specify several additonal
attributes for the option:

`file-exists'
     If not specified or empty, then the directory portion of the name
     is checked.  The directory must exist or the argument is rejected
     and the usage procedure is invoked.

     Otherwise, both the directory as above and the full name is tested
     for existence.  If the value begins with the two letters `no',
     then the file must not pre-exist.  Otherwise, the file is expected
     to exist.

`open-file'
     If not specified or empty, the file is left alone.  If the value
     begins with the four letters `desc'[riptor], then `open(2)' is
     used and `optArg.argFd' is set.  Otherwise, the file is opened
     with `fopen' and `optArg.argFp' is set.

`file-mode'
     If `open-file' is set and not empty, then you must specify the
     open mode.  Set the value to the flag bits or mode string as
     appropriate for the open type.

7.5.6.8 Arg Type Time Duration
..............................

`arg-type = time-duration;'

   The argument will be converted into a number of seconds.  It may be
a multi-part number with different parts being multiplied into a seconds
value and added into the final result.  Valid forms are in the table
below.  Upper cased letters represent numbers that must be used in the
expressions.

`[[HH:]MM:]SS'
     `HH' is multiplied by `3600' and `MM' multiplied by `60' before
     they are added to `SS'.  This time specification may not be
     followed by any other time specs.  `HH' and `MM' are both optional,
     though `HH' cannot be specified without `MM'.

`DAYS d'
     `DAYS' is multiplied by the number of seconds in a day.  This
     value may be followed by (and added to) values specified by
     `HH:MM:SS' or the suffixed values below.  If present, it must
     always be first.

`HRS h'
     `HRS' is multiplied by the number of seconds in an hour.  This
     value may be followed by (and added to) values specified by
     `MM:SS' or the suffixed values below.

`MINS m'
     `MINS' is multiplied by the number of seconds in a minute.  This
     value may be followed by (and added to) a count of seconds.

`SECS s'
     This value can only be the last value in a time specification.
     The `s' suffix is optional.

       5 d 1:10:05    ==> 5 days + 1 hour 10 minutes and 5 seconds
       5 d 1 h 10 m 5 ==> yields: 436205 seconds
       5d1h10m5s      ==> same result -- spaces are optional.

   When saved into a config file, the value will be stored as a simple
count of seconds.  There are actually more (many) accepted time
duration strings.  The full documentation can be found with ISO-8601
documentation and the more extedded documentation when
`parse_duration()' becomes more widely available.

7.5.6.9 Arg Type Time and Date
..............................

`arg-type = time-date;'

   The argument will be converted into the number of seconds since the
epoch.  The conversion rules are very complicated, please see the
`getdate_r(3GNU)' man page.  There are some additional restrictions:

  1. Your project must be compiled with `PKGDATADIR' defined and naming
     a valid directory.

  2. The `DATEMSK' environment variable will be set to the `datemsk'
     file within that directory.

   If that file is not accessible for any reason, the string will be
parsed as a time duration (*note arg-type time-duration::) instead of a
specific date and time.

7.5.6.10 Keyword list
.....................

If the `arg-type' is `keyword' (*note arg-type keyword::) or
`set-membership' (*note arg-type set membership::), then you must
specify the list of keywords by a series of `keyword' entries.  The
interface file will contain values for `<OPTN_NAME>_<KEYWORD>' for each
keyword entry.  `keyword' option types will have an enumeration and
`set-membership' option types will have a set of unsigned bits
`#define'-d.

   If the `arg-type' is specifically `keyword', you may also add
special handling code with a `extra-code' attribute.  After
`optionEnumerationVal' has converted the input string into an
enumeration, you may insert code to process this enumeration value
(`pOptDesc->optArg.argEnum').

7.5.6.11 Option Argument Optional
.................................

The `arg-optional' attribute indicates that the argument to the option
is optional (need not be specified on the command line).  This is only
valid if the ARG-TYPE is `string' (*note arg-type string::) or
`keyword' (*note arg-type keyword::).  If it is `keyword', then this
attribute may also specify the default keyword to assume when the
argument is not supplied.  If left empty, ARG-DEFAULT (*note
arg-default::) or the zero-valued keyword will be used.

   The syntax rules for identifying the option argument are:
   * If the option is specified with a flag character and there is a
     character following the flag character, then string following that
     flag character is the option argument.

   * If the flag character is the last character in an argument, then
     the first character of the next argument is examined.  If it is a
     hyphen, then the option is presumed to not have an argument.
     Otherwise, the entire next argument is the argument for the option.

   * If the option is specified with a long option name and that name
     is ended with an equal sign character (`='), then everything after
     that character is the option argument.

   * If the long name is ended by the end of the argument, then the
     first character of the next argument is examined, just as with the
     flag character ending an argument string.

   This is overridden and the options are required if the libopts
library gets configured with `--disable-optional-args'.

7.5.6.12 Default Option Argument Value
......................................

This specifies the default option argument value to be used when the
option is not specified or preset.  You may specify multiple
`arg-default' values if the argument type is `set membership'.

7.5.7 Option Argument Handling
------------------------------

AutoOpts will either specify or automatically generate callback
procedures for options that take specialized arguments.  The only
option argument types that are not specialized are plain string
arguments and no argument at all.  For options that fall into one of
those two categories, you may specify your own callback function, as
specified below.  If you do this and if you specify that options are
resettable (*note automatic options::), then your option handling code
*must* look for the `OPTST_RESET' bit in the `fOptState' field of the
option descriptor.

   If the option takes a string argument, then the `stack-arg'
attribute can be used to specify that the option is to be handled by
the `libopts' `stackOptArg()' and `unstackOptArg()' library procedures
(see below).  In this case, you may not provide option handling code.

   Finally, `documentation' options (*note opt-attr documentation::) may
also be marked as `settable' (*note opt-attr settable::) and have
special callback functions (either `flag-code', `extract-code', or
`call-proc').

`flag-code'
     statements to execute when the option is encountered.  This may be
     used in conjunction with option argument types that cause AutoOpts
     to emit handler code.  If you do this, the `flag-code' with index
     zero (0) is emitted into the handler code _before_ the argument is
     handled, and the entry with index one (1) is handled afterward.

     The generated procedure will be laid out something like this:

         static void
         doOpt<name>(tOptions* pOptions, tOptDesc* pOptDesc)
         {
         <flag-code[0]>
         <AutoOpts defined handler code>
         <flag-code[1]>
         }

     Only certain fields within the `tOptions' and `tOptDesc'
     structures may be accessed.  *Note Option Processing Data::.  When
     writing this code, you must be very careful with the `pOptions'
     pointer.  The handler code is called with this pointer set to
     special values for handling special situations.  Your code must
     handle them.  As an example, look at `optionEnumerationVal' in
     `enum.c'.

`extract-code'
     This is effectively identical to `flag-code', except that the
     source is kept in the output file instead of the definitions file
     and you cannot use this in conjunction with options with arguments,
     other than string arguments.

     A long comment is used to demarcate the code.  You must not modify
     that marker.  Before regenerating the option code file, the old
     file is renamed from MUMBLE.c to MUMBLE.c.save.  The template will
     be looking there for the text to copy into the new output file.

`call-proc'
     external procedure to call when option is encountered.  The calling
     sequence must conform to the sequence defined above for the
     generated procedure, `doOpt<name>'.  It has the same restrictions
     regarding the fields within the structures passed in as arguments.
     *Note Option Processing Data::.

`flag-proc'
     Name of another option whose `flag-code' can be executed when this
     option is encountered.

`stack-arg'
     Call a special library routine to stack the option's arguments.
     Special macros in the interface file are provided for determining
     how many of the options were found (`STACKCT_OPT(NAME)') and to
     obtain a pointer to a list of pointers to the argument values
     (`STACKLST_OPT(NAME)').  Obviously, for a stackable argument, the
     `max' attribute (*note Common Attributes::) needs to be set higher
     than `1'.

     If this stacked argument option has a disablement prefix, then the
     entire stack of arguments will be cleared by specifying the option
     with that disablement prefix.

`unstack-arg'
     Call a special library routine to remove (`unstack') strings from
     a `stack-arg' option stack.  This attribute must name the option
     that is to be `unstacked'.  Neither this option nor the stacked
     argument option it references may be equivalenced to another
     option.

7.5.8 Internationalizing Options
--------------------------------

Normally, AutoOpts produces usage text that is difficult to translate.
It is pieced together on the fly using words and phrases scattered
around here and there, piecing together toe document.  This does not
translate well.

   Incorporated into this package are some ways around the problem.
First, you should specify the `full-usage' and `short-usage' program
attributes (*note program attributes::).  This will enable your
translators to translate the usage text as a whole.

   Your translators will also be able to translate long option names.
The option name translations will then become the names searched for
both on the command line and in configuration files.  However, it will
not affect the names of environment variable names used to configure
your program.

   If it is considered desireable to keep configuration files in the `C'
locale, then several macros are available to suppress or delay the
translations of option names at run time.  These are all disabled if
`ENABLE_NLS' is not defined at compile time or if `no-xlate' has been
set to the value _anything_.  These macros *must* be invoked before the
first invocation of `optionProcess'.

`OPT_NO_XLAT_CFG_NAMES;'
`OPT_XLAT_CFG_NAMES;'
     Disable (or enable) the translations of option names for
     configuration files.  If you enable translation for config files,
     then they will be translated for command line options.

`OPT_NO_XLAT_OPT_NAMES;'
`OPT_XLAT_OPT_NAMES;'
     Disable (or enable) the translations of option names for command
     line processing.  If you disable the translation for command line
     processing, you will also disable it for configuration file
     processing.  Once translated, the option names will remain
     translated.

7.5.9 Man and Info doc Attributes
---------------------------------

AutoOpts includes AutoGen templates for producing abbreviated man pages
and for producing the invoking section of an info document.  To take
advantage of these templates, you must add several attributes to your
option definitions.

7.5.9.1 Per option documentation attributes
...........................................

These attributes are sub-attributes (sub-stanzas) of the `flag' stanzas.

`arg-name'
     If an option has an argument, the argument should have a name for
     documentation purposes.  It will default to `arg-type', but it
     will likely be clearer with something else like, `file-name'
     instead of `string' (the type).

`doc'
     First, every `flag' definition _other than_ `documentation'
     definitions, must have a `doc' attribute defined.  If the option
     takes an argument, then it will need an `arg-name' attribute as
     well.  The `doc' text should be in plain sentences with minimal
     formatting.  The Texinfo commands `@code', and `@var' will have
     its enclosed text made into *\fB* entries in the man page, and the
     `@file' text will be made into *\fI* entries.  The `arg-name'
     attribute is used to display the option's argument in the man page.

     Options marked with the `documentation' attribute are for
     documenting the usage text.  All other options should have the
     `doc' attribute in order to document the usage of the option in
     the generated man pages.

     Since these blocks of text are inserted into all output forms, any
     markup text included in these blocks must be massaged for each
     output format.  By default, it is presumed to be `texi' format.

7.5.9.2 Global documentation attributes
.......................................

`cmd-section'
     If your command is a game or a system management command, specify
     this attribute with the value `5' or `8', respectively.  The
     default is a user command (section 1).

`detail'
     This attribute is used to add a very short explanation about what
     a program is used for when the `title' attribute is insufficient.
     If there is no `doc-section' stanza of type `DESCRIPTION', then
     this text is used for the man page DESCRIPTION section, too.

`addtogroup'
     This attribute tells the template that the generated code should be
     surrounded with the following doxygen comments:
         /** @file <header-or-code-file-name>
          *  @addtogroup <value-of-addtogroup>
          *  @{
          */
     and
         /** @} */

`option-format'
     Specify the default markup style for the `doc' stanzas.  By
     default, it is `texi', but `man' and `mdoc' may also be selected.
     There are nine converter programs that do a partial job of
     converting one form of markup into another.  `texi2texi',
     `man2man' and `mdoc2mdoc' work pretty well.

     You may also post process the document by using `doc-sub' stanzas,
     see below.

`option-info'
     This text will be inserted as a lead-in paragraph in the `OPTIONS'
     section of the generated man page.

`doc-section'
     This is a compound attribute that requires three subattributes:

    ds-format
          This describes the format of the associated `ds-text' section.
          `man', `mdoc' and `texi' formats are supported.  Regardless
          of the chosen format, the formatting tags in the output text
          will be converted to `man' macros for `man' pages, `mdoc'
          macros for `mdoc' pages, and `texi' macros for `texinfo'
          pages.

    ds-text
          This is the descriptive text, written according to the rules
          for `ds-format' documents.

    ds-type
          This describes the section type.  Basically, the title of the
          section that will be added to all output documentation.
          There may be only one `doc-section' for any given `ds-type'.
          If there are duplicates, the results are undefined (it might
          work, it might not).

          There are five categories of `ds-type' sections.  They are
          those that the documentation templates would otherwise:
            1. always create itself, ignoring any `ds-type's by this
               name.  These are marked, below, as `ao-only'.

            2. create, if none was provided.  These are marked,
               `alternate'.

            3. create, but augment if the `doc-section' was provided.
               These are marked, `augments'.

            4. do nothing, but inserts them into the output in a
               prescribed order.  These are marked, `known'

            5. knows nothing about them.  They will be alphabetized and
               inserted after the list of leading sections and before
               the list of trailing sections.  These are not marked
               because I don't know their names.

          Some of these are emitted by the documentation templates only
          if certain conditions are met.  If there are conditions, they
          are explained below.  If there are no conditions, then you
          will always see the named section in the output.

          The output sections will appear in this order:
         `NAME'
               `ao-only'.

         `SYNOPSIS'
               `alternate'.

         `DESCRIPTION'
               `augments'.

         `OPTIONS'
               `ao-only'.

         `OPTION PRESETS'
               `ao-only', if environment presets or configuration file
               processing has been specified.

         `unknown'
               At this point, the unknown, alphabetized sections are
               inserted.

         `IMPLEMENTATION NOTES'
               `known'

         `ENVIRONMENT'
               `augments', if environment presets have been specified.

         `FILES'
               `augments', if configuration file processing has been
               specified.

         `EXAMPLES'
               `known'

         `EXIT STATUS'
               `augments'.

         `ERRORS'
               `known'

         `COMPATIBILITY'
               `known'

         `SEE ALSO'
               `known'

         `CONFORMING TO'
               `known'

         `HISTORY'
               `known'

         `AUTHORS'
               `alternate', if the `copyright' stanza has either an
               `author' or an `owner' attribute.

         `COPYRIGHT'
               `alternate', if there is a `copyright' stanza.

         `BUGS'
               `augments', if the `copyright' stanza has an `eaddr'
               attribute.

         `NOTES'
               `augments'.

     Here is an example of a `doc-section' for a `SEE ALSO' type.

         doc-section = {
           ds-type   = 'SEE ALSO'; // or anything else
           ds-format = 'man';      // or texi or mdoc format
           ds-text   = <<-_EOText_
         	text relevant to this section type,
         	in the chosen format
         	_EOText_;
         };

`doc-sub'
     This attribute will cause the resulting documentation to be
     post-processed.  This is normally with `sed', see `doc-sub-cmd'
     below.  This attribute has several sub-attributes:

    `sub-name'
          This is the name of an autogen text definition value, like
          `prog-name' or `version'.  In the `sub-text' field,
          occurrences of this name preceded by two less than characters
          and followed by two greater than characters will be replaced
          by the text value of the definition, e.g. `<<prog-name>>'.

    `sub-text'
          The text that gets added to the command file for the post
          processing program.

    `sub-type'
          If this command only applies to certain types of output,
          specify this with a regular expression that will match one of
          the valid output format types, e.g. `man|mdoc' will match
          those two kinds, but not `texi' output.  If omitted, it will
          always apply.

     For example, if you want to reference the program name in the `doc'
     text for an option common to two programs, put `#PROG#' into the
     text.  The following will replace all occrrences of `#PROG#' with
     the current value for `prog':
         doc-sub = {
           sub-name = prog-name;
           sub-text = 's/#PROG#/<<prog-name>>/g';
         };

`doc-sub-cmd'
     A formatting string for constructing the post-processing command.
     The first parameter is the name of the file with editing commands
     in it, and the second is the file containing the unprocessed
     document.  The default value is:
         sed -f %s %s

7.5.10 Automatically Supported Options
--------------------------------------

AutoOpts provides automated support for several options.  `help' and
`more-help' are always provided.  The others are conditional upon
various global program attributes being defined *Note program
attributes::.

   Below are the option names and default flag values.  The flags are
activated if and only if at least one user-defined option also uses a
flag value.  The long names are supported as option names if
`long-opts' has been specified.  These option flags may be deleted or
changed to characters of your choosing by specifying `xxx-value =
"y";', where `xxx' is one of the option names below and `y' is either
empty or the character of your choice.  For example, to change the help
flag from `?' to `h', specify `help-value = "h";'; and to require that
`save-opts' be specified only with its long option name, specify `save-opts-value
= "";'.

   Additionally, the procedure that prints out the program version may
be replaced by specifying `version-proc'.  This procedure must be
defined to be of external scope (non-static).  By default, the AutoOpts
library provides `optionPrintVersion' and it will be the specified
callback function in the option definition structure.

   With the exception of the `load-opts' option, none of these
automatically supported options will be recognized in configuration
files or environment variables.

`help -?'
     This option will immediately invoke the `USAGE()' procedure and
     display the usage line, a description of each option with its
     description and option usage information.  This is followed by the
     contents of the definition of the `detail' text macro.

`more-help -!'
     This option is identical to the `help' option, except that the
     output is passed through a pager program.  (`more' by default, or
     the program identified by the `PAGER' environment variable.)

`usage -u'
     This option must be requested by specifying, `usage-opt' in the
     option definition file.  It will produce abbreviated help text to
     `stdout' and exit with zero status (`EXIT_SUCCESS').

`version -v'
     This will print the program name, title and version.  If it is
     followed by the letter `c' and a value for `copyright' and `owner'
     have been provided, then the copyright will be printed, too.  If
     it is followed by the letter `n', then the full copyright notice
     (if available) will be printed.  The `version' attribute must be
     specified in the option definition file.

`load-opts -<'
     This option will load options from the named file.  They will be
     treated exactly as if they were loaded from the normally found
     configuration files, but will not be loaded until the option is
     actually processed.  This can also be used within another
     configuration file, causing them to nest.  This is the *only*
     automatically supported option that can be activated inside of
     config files or with environment variables.

     Specifying the negated form of the option (`--no-load-opts') will
     suppress the processing of configuration files and environment
     variables.

     This option is activated by specifying one or more `homerc'
     attributes.

`save-opts ->'
     This option will cause the option state to be printed in the
     configuration file format when option processing is done but not
     yet verified for consistency.  The program will terminate
     successfully without running when this has completed.  Note that
     for most shells you will have to quote or escape the flag
     character to restrict special meanings to the shell.

     The output file will be the configuration file name (default or
     provided by `rcfile') in the last directory named in a `homerc'
     definition.

     This option may be set from within your program by invoking the
     "`SET_OPT_SAVE_OPTS(filename)'" macro (*note SET_OPT_name::).
     Invoking this macro will set the file name for saving the option
     processing state, but the state will *not* actually be saved.  You
     must call `optionSaveFile' to do that (*note
     libopts-optionSaveFile::).  *CAVEAT:* if, after invoking this
     macro, you call `optionProcess', the option processing state will
     be saved to this file and `optionProcess' will not return.  You
     may wish to invoke `CLEAR_OPT( SAVE_OPTS )' (*note CLEAR_OPT::)
     beforehand if you do need to reinvoke `optionProcess'.

     This option is activated by specifying one or more `homerc'
     attributes.

`reset-option -R'
     This option takes the name of an option for the current program
     and resets its state such that it is set back to its original,
     compile-time initialized value.  If the option state is
     subsequently stored (via `--save-opts'), the named option will not
     appear in that file.

     This option is activated by specifying the `resettable' attribute.

     *BEWARE*:  If the `resettable' attribute is specified, all option
     callbacks *must* look for the `OPTST_RESET' bit in the `fOptState'
     field of the option descriptor.  If set, the `optCookie' and
     `optArg' fields will be unchanged from their last setting.  When
     the callback returns, these fields will be set to their original
     values.  If you use this feature and you have allocated data
     hanging off of the cookie, you need to deallocate it.

7.5.11 Library of Standard Options
----------------------------------

AutoOpts has developed a set of standardized options.  You may
incorporate these options in your program simply by _first_ adding a
`#define' for the options you want, and then the line,

    #include stdoptions.def

in your option definitions.  The supported options are specified thus:

    #define DEBUG
    #define DIRECTORY
    #define DRY_RUN
    #define INPUT
    #define INTERACTIVE
    #define OUTPUT
    #define WARN

    #define SILENT
    #define QUIET
    #define BRIEF
    #define VERBOSE

   By default, only the long form of the option will be available.  To
specify the short (flag) form, suffix these names with `_FLAG'.  e.g.,

    #define DEBUG_FLAG

   `--silent', `--quiet', `--brief' and `--verbose' are related in that
they all indicate some level of diagnostic output.  These options are
all designed to conflict with each other.  Instead of four different
options, however, several levels can be incorporated by `#define'-ing
`VERBOSE_ENUM'.  In conjunction with `VERBOSE', it incorporates the
notion of 5 levels in an enumeration: `silent', `quiet', `brief',
`informative' and `verbose'; with the default being `brief'.

   Here is an example program that uses the following set of
definitions:

    AutoGen Definitions options;

    prog-name  = default-test;
    prog-title = 'Default Option Example';
    homerc     = '$$/../share/default-test', '$HOME', '.';
    environrc;
    long-opts;
    gnu-usage;
    usage-opt;
    version    = '1.0';
    main = {
      main-type = shell-process;
    };
    #define DEBUG_FLAG
    #define WARN_FLAG
    #define WARN_LEVEL
    #define VERBOSE_FLAG
    #define VERBOSE_ENUM
    #define DRY_RUN_FLAG
    #define OUTPUT_FLAG
    #define INPUT_FLAG
    #define DIRECTORY_FLAG
    #define INTERACTIVE_FLAG
    #include stdoptions.def

Running a few simple commands on that definition file:

    autogen default-test.def
    copts="-DTEST_DEFAULT_TEST_OPTS `autoopts-config cflags`"
    lopts="`autoopts-config ldflags`"
    cc -o default-test ${copts} default-test.c ${lopts}

Yields a program which, when run with `--help', prints out:


    exit 0

7.6 Programmatic Interface
==========================

The user interface for access to the argument information is completely
defined in the generated header file and in the portions of the
distributed file "options.h" that are marked "public".

   In the following macros, text marked <NAME> or NAME is the name of
the option *in upper case* and *segmented with underscores `_'*.  The
macros and enumerations defined in the options header (interface) file
are used as follows:

   To see how these `#define' macros are used in a program, the reader
is referred to the several `opts.h' files included with the AutoGen
sources.

7.6.1 Data for Option Processing
--------------------------------

This section describes the data that may be accessed from within the
option processing callback routines.  The following fields may be used
in the following ways and may be used for read only.  The first set is
addressed from the `tOptDesc*' pointer:

`optIndex'

`optValue'
     These may be used by option procedures to determine which option
     they are working on (in case they handle several options).

`optActualIndex'

`optActualValue'
     These may be used by option procedures to determine which option
     was used to set the current option.  This may be different from
     the above if the options are members of an equivalence class.

`optOccCt'
     If AutoOpts is processing command line arguments, then this value
     will contain the current occurrence count.  During the option
     preset phase (reading configuration files and examining
     environment variables), the value is zero.

`fOptState'
     The field may be tested for the following bit values (prefix each
     name with `OPTST_', e.g. `OPTST_INIT'):

    `INIT'
          Initial compiled value.  As a bit test, it will always yield
          FALSE.

    `SET'
          The option was set via the `SET_OPT()' macro.

    `PRESET'
          The option was set via a configuration file.

    `DEFINED'
          The option was set via a command line option.

    `SET_MASK'
          This is a mask of flags that show the set state, one of the
          above four values.

    `EQUIVALENCE'
          This bit is set when the option was selected by an
          equivalenced option.

    `DISABLED'
          This bit is set if the option is to be disabled.  (Meaning it
          was a long option prefixed by the disablement prefix, or the
          option has not been specified yet and initializes as
          `disabled'.)

     As an example of how this might be used, in AutoGen I want to allow
     template writers to specify that the template output can be left
     in a writable or read-only state.  To support this, there is a
     Guile function named `set-writable' (*note SCM set-writable::).
     Also, I provide for command options `--writable' and
     `--not-writable'.  I give precedence to command line and RC file
     options, thus:

         switch (STATE_OPT( WRITABLE )) {
         case OPTST_DEFINED:
         case OPTST_PRESET:
             fprintf(stderr, zOverrideWarn, pCurTemplate->pzFileName,
                     pCurMacro->lineNo);
             break;

         default:
             if (gh_boolean_p( set ) && (set == SCM_BOOL_F))
                 CLEAR_OPT( WRITABLE );
             else
                 SET_OPT_WRITABLE;
         }

`pzLastArg'
     Pointer to the latest argument string.  BEWARE If the argument type
     is numeric, an enumeration or a bit mask, then this will be the
     argument *value* and not a pointer to a string.

   The following two fields are addressed from the `tOptions*' pointer:

`pzProgName'
     Points to a NUL-terminated string containing the current program
     name, as retrieved from the argument vector.

`pzProgPath'
     Points to a NUL-terminated string containing the full path of the
     current program, as retrieved from the argument vector.  (If
     available on your system.)


   Note  these fields get filled in during the first call to
`optionProcess()'.  All other fields are private, for the exclusive use
of AutoOpts code and are subject to change.

7.6.2 CLEAR_OPT( <NAME> ) - Clear Option Markings
-------------------------------------------------

Make as if the option had never been specified.  `HAVE_OPT(<NAME>)'
will yield `FALSE' after invoking this macro.

7.6.3 COUNT_OPT( <NAME> ) - Definition Count
--------------------------------------------

This macro will tell you how many times the option was specified on the
command line.  It does not include counts of preset options.

    if (COUNT_OPT( NAME ) != desired-count) {
        make-an-undesirable-message.
    }

7.6.4 DESC( <NAME> ) - Option Descriptor
----------------------------------------

This macro is used internally by other AutoOpt macros.  It is not for
general use.  It is used to obtain the option description corresponding
to its *UPPER CASED* option name argument.  This is primarily used in
other macro definitions.

7.6.5 DISABLE_OPT_name - Disable an option
------------------------------------------

This macro is emitted if it is both settable and it can be disabled.
If it cannot be disabled, it may always be CLEAR-ed (see above).

   The form of the macro will actually depend on whether the option is
equivalenced to another, and/or has an assigned handler procedure.
Unlike the `SET_OPT' macro, this macro does not allow an option
argument.

    DISABLE_OPT_NAME;

7.6.6 ENABLED_OPT( <NAME> ) - Is Option Enabled?
------------------------------------------------

Yields true if the option defaults to disabled and `ISUNUSED_OPT()'
would yield true.  It also yields true if the option has been specified
with a disablement prefix, disablement value or the `DISABLE_OPT_NAME'
macro was invoked.

7.6.7 ERRSKIP_OPTERR - Ignore Option Errors
-------------------------------------------

When it is necessary to continue (return to caller) on option errors,
invoke this option.  It is reversible.  *Note ERRSTOP_OPTERR::.

7.6.8 ERRSTOP_OPTERR - Stop on Errors
-------------------------------------

After invoking this macro, if `optionProcess()' encounters an error, it
will call `exit(1)' rather than return.  This is the default processing
mode.  It can be overridden by specifying `allow-errors' in the
definitions file, or invoking the macro *Note ERRSKIP_OPTERR::.

7.6.9 HAVE_OPT( <NAME> ) - Have this option?
--------------------------------------------

This macro yields true if the option has been specified in any fashion
at all.  It is used thus:

    if (HAVE_OPT( NAME )) {
        <do-things-associated-with-opt-name>;
    }

7.6.10 ISSEL_OPT( <NAME> ) - Is Option Selected?
------------------------------------------------

This macro yields true if the option has been specified either on the
command line or via a SET/DISABLE macro.

7.6.11 ISUNUSED_OPT( <NAME> ) - Never Specified?
------------------------------------------------

This macro yields true if the option has never been specified, or has
been cleared via the `CLEAR_OPT()' macro.

7.6.12 OPTION_CT - Full Count of Options
----------------------------------------

The full count of all options, both those defined and those generated
automatically by AutoOpts.  This is primarily used to initialize the
program option descriptor structure.

7.6.13 OPT_ARG( <NAME> ) - Option Argument String
-------------------------------------------------

The option argument value as a pointer to string.  Note that argument
values that have been specified as numbers are stored as numbers or
keywords.  For such options, use instead the `OPT_VALUE_name' define.
It is used thus:

    if (HAVE_OPT( NAME )) {
        char* p = OPT_ARG( NAME );
        <do-things-with-opt-name-argument-string>;
    }

7.6.14 OPT_NO_XLAT_CFG_NAMES - option name xlation
--------------------------------------------------

Invoking this macro will disable the translation of option names only
while processing configuration files and environment variables.  This
must be invoked before the first call to `optionProcess'..  You need
not invoke this if your option definition file contains the attribute
assignment, `no-xlate = opt-cfg;'.

7.6.15 OPT_NO_XLAT_OPT_NAMES - option name xlation
--------------------------------------------------

Invoking this macro will completely disable the translation of option
names.  This must be invoked before the first call to `optionProcess'.
You need not invoke this if your option definition file contains the
attribute assignment, `no-xlate = opt;'.

7.6.16 OPT_VALUE_name - Option Argument Value
---------------------------------------------

This macro gets emitted only for options that take numeric, keyword or
set membership arguments.  The macro yields a word-sized integer
containing the enumeration, bit set or numeric value for the option
argument.

    int opt_val = OPT_VALUE_name;

7.6.17 OPT_XLAT_CFG_NAMES - option name xlation
-----------------------------------------------

If `ENABLE_NLS' is defined and `no-xlate' has been not set to the value
_anything_, this macro will cause the translation of option names to
happen before starting the processing of configuration files and
environment variables.  This will change the recognition of options
within the `$PROGRAMNAME' environment variable, but will not alter the
names used for setting options via `$PROGRAMNAME_name' environment
variables.

   This must be invoked before the first call to `optionProcess'.  You
might need to use this macro if your option definition file contains
the attribute assignment, `no-xlate = opt;' or `no-xlate = opt-cfg;',
and you have determined in some way that you wish to override that.

7.6.18 OPT_XLAT_OPT_NAMES - option name xlation
-----------------------------------------------

If `ENABLE_NLS' is defined and `no-xlate' has been not set to the value
_anything_, translate the option names before processing the command
line options.  Long option names may thus be localized.  (If the names
were translated before configuration processing, they will not be
re-translated.)

   This must be invoked before the first call to `optionProcess'.  You
might need to use this macro if your option definition file contains
the attribute assignment, `no-xlate = opt;' and you have determined in
some way that you wish to override that.

7.6.19 RESTART_OPT( n ) - Resume Option Processing
--------------------------------------------------

If option processing has stopped (either because of an error or
something was encountered that looked like a program argument), it can
be resumed by providing this macro with the index `n' of the next
option to process and calling `optionProcess()' again.

    int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
      for (int ai = 0; ai < argc ;) {
      restart:
        ai = optionProcess(&progOptions, argc, argv);
        for (; ai < argc; ai++) {
          char * arg = arg[ai];
          if (*arg == '-') {
            RESTART_OPT(ai);
            goto restart;
          }
          process(arg);
        }
      }
    }

   If you want a program to operate this way, you might consider
specifying a `for-each' main function (*note for-each main procedure:
main for-each.) with the `interleaved' attribute.  It will allow you to
process interleaved operands and options from either the command line
or when reading them from standard input.

7.6.20 SET_OPT_name - Force an option to be set
-----------------------------------------------

This macro gets emitted only when the given option has the `settable'
attribute specified.

   The form of the macro will actually depend on whether the option is
equivalenced to another, has an option argument and/or has an assigned
handler procedure.  If the option has an argument, then this macro will
too.  Beware that the argument is not reallocated, so the value must not
be on the stack or deallocated in any other way for as long as the value
might get referenced.

   If you have supplied at least one `homerc' file (*note program
attributes::), this macro will be emitted for the `--save-opts' option.

    SET_OPT_SAVE_OPTS( "filename" );

*Note automatic options::, for a discussion of the implications of using
this particular example.

7.6.21 STACKCT_OPT( <NAME> ) - Stacked Arg Count
------------------------------------------------

When the option handling attribute is specified as `stack_arg', this
macro may be used to determine how many of them actually got stacked.

   Do not use this on options that have not been stacked or has not been
specified (the `stack_arg' attribute must have been specified, and
`HAVE_OPT(<NAME>)' must yield TRUE).  Otherwise, you will likely seg
fault.

    if (HAVE_OPT( NAME )) {
        int     ct = STACKCT_OPT(  NAME );
        char**  pp = STACKLST_OPT( NAME );

        do  {
            char* p = *pp++;
            do-things-with-p;
        } while (--ct > 0);
    }

7.6.22 STACKLST_OPT( <NAME> ) - Argument Stack
----------------------------------------------

The address of the list of pointers to the option arguments.  The
pointers are ordered by the order in which they were encountered in the
option presets and command line processing.

   Do not use this on options that have not been stacked or has not been
specified (the `stack_arg' attribute must have been specified, and
`HAVE_OPT(<OPTION>)' must yield TRUE).  Otherwise, you will likely seg
fault.

    if (HAVE_OPT( NAME )) {
        int     ct = STACKCT_OPT(  NAME );
        char**  pp = STACKLST_OPT( NAME );

        do  {
            char* p = *pp++;
            do-things-with-p;
        } while (--ct > 0);
    }

7.6.23 START_OPT - Restart Option Processing
--------------------------------------------

This is just a shortcut for RESTART_OPT(1) (*Note RESTART_OPT::.)

7.6.24 STATE_OPT( <NAME> ) - Option State
-----------------------------------------

If you need to know if an option was set because of presetting actions
(configuration file processing or environment variables), versus a
command line entry versus one of the SET/DISABLE macros, then use this
macro.  It will yield one of four values: `OPTST_INIT', `OPTST_SET',
`OPTST_PRESET' or `OPTST_DEFINED'.  It is used thus:

    switch (STATE_OPT( NAME )) {
        case OPTST_INIT:
            not-preset, set or on the command line.  (unless CLEAR-ed)

        case OPTST_SET:
            option set via the SET_OPT_NAME() macro.

        case OPTST_PRESET:
            option set via an configuration file or environment variable

        case OPTST_DEFINED:
            option set via a command line option.

        default:
            cannot happen :)
    }

7.6.25 USAGE( exit-code ) - Usage invocation macro
--------------------------------------------------

This macro invokes the procedure registered to display the usage text.
Normally, this will be `optionUsage' from the AutoOpts library, but you
may select another procedure by specifying `usage = "proc_name"'
program attribute.  This procedure must take two arguments  first, a
pointer to the option descriptor, and second the exit code.  The macro
supplies the option descriptor automatically.  This routine is expected
to call `exit(3)' with the provided exit code.

   The `optionUsage' routine also behaves differently depending on the
exit code:

`EXIT_SUCCESS (the value zero)'
     It is assumed that full usage help has been requested.
     Consequently, more information is provided than when displaying
     usage and exiting with a non-zero exit code.  Output will be sent
     to `stdout' and the program will exit with a zero status code.

`EX_USAGE (64)'
     The abbreviated usage will be printed to `stdout' and the program
     will exit with a zero status code.  `EX_USAGE' may or may not be
     64.  If your system provides `/usr/include/sysexits.h' that has a
     different value, then that value will be used.

`any other value'
     The abbreviated usage will be printed to stderr and the program
     will exit with the provided status code.

7.6.26 VALUE_OPT_name - Option Flag Value
-----------------------------------------

This is a #define for the flag character used to specify an option on
the command line.  If `value' was not specified for the option, then it
is a unique number associated with the option.  `option value' refers
to this value, `option argument' refers to the (optional) argument to
the option.

    switch (WHICH_OPT_OTHER_OPT) {
    case VALUE_OPT_NAME:
        this-option-was-really-opt-name;
    case VALUE_OPT_OTHER_OPT:
        this-option-was-really-other-opt;
    }

7.6.27 VERSION - Version and Full Version
-----------------------------------------

If the `version' attribute is defined for the program, then a
stringified version will be #defined as PROGRAM_VERSION and
PROGRAM_FULL_VERSION.  PROGRAM_FULL_VERSION is used for printing the
program version in response to the version option.  The version option
is automatically supplied in response to this attribute, too.

   You may access PROGRAM_VERSION via `programOptions.pzFullVersion'.

7.6.28 WHICH_IDX_name - Which Equivalenced Index
------------------------------------------------

This macro gets emitted only for equivalenced-to options.  It is used to
obtain the index for the one of the several equivalence class members
set the equivalenced-to option.

    switch (WHICH_IDX_OTHER_OPT) {
    case INDEX_OPT_NAME:
        this-option-was-really-opt-name;
    case INDEX_OPT_OTHER_OPT:
        this-option-was-really-other-opt;
    }

7.6.29 WHICH_OPT_name - Which Equivalenced Option
-------------------------------------------------

This macro gets emitted only for equivalenced-to options.  It is used to
obtain the value code for the one of the several equivalence class
members set the equivalenced-to option.

    switch (WHICH_OPT_OTHER_OPT) {
    case VALUE_OPT_NAME:
        this-option-was-really-opt-name;
    case VALUE_OPT_OTHER_OPT:
        this-option-was-really-other-opt;
    }

7.6.30 teOptIndex - Option Index and Enumeration
------------------------------------------------

This enum defines the complete set of options, both user specified and
automatically provided.  This can be used, for example, to distinguish
which of the equivalenced options was actually used.

    switch (pOptDesc->optActualIndex) {
    case INDEX_OPT_FIRST:
        stuff;
    case INDEX_OPT_DIFFERENT:
        different-stuff;
    default:
        unknown-things;
    }

7.6.31 OPTIONS_STRUCT_VERSION - active version
----------------------------------------------

You will not actually need to reference this value, but you need to be
aware that it is there.  It is the first value in the option descriptor
that you pass to `optionProcess'.  It contains a magic number and
version information.  Normally, you should be able to work with a more
recent option library than the one you compiled with.  However, if the
library is changed incompatibly, then the library will detect the out of
date magic marker, explain the difficulty and exit.  You will then need
to rebuild and recompile your option definitions.  This has rarely been
necessary.

7.6.32 libopts External Procedures
----------------------------------

These are the routines that libopts users may call directly from their
code.  There are several other routines that can be called by code
generated by the libopts option templates, but they are not to be
called from any other user code.  The `options.h' header is fairly
clear about this, too.

   This subsection was automatically generated by AutoGen using
extracted information and the aginfo3.tpl template.

7.6.32.1 ao_string_tokenize
...........................

tokenize an input string

Usage:
    token_list_t * res = ao_string_tokenize( string );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     string      `char const *' string to be tokenized
     returns     token_list_t * pointer to a structure that lists each
                                token

   This function will convert one input string into a list of strings.
The list of strings is derived by separating the input based on white
space separation.  However, if the input contains either single or
double quote characters, then the text after that character up to a
matching quote will become the string in the list.

   The returned pointer should be deallocated with `free(3C)' when are
done using the data.  The data are placed in a single block of
allocated memory.  Do not deallocate individual token/strings.

   The structure pointed to will contain at least these two fields:
`tkn_ct'
     The number of tokens found in the input string.

`tok_list'
     An array of `tkn_ct + 1' pointers to substring tokens, with the
     last pointer set to NULL.

   There are two types of quoted strings: single quoted (`'') and
double quoted (`"').  Singly quoted strings are fairly raw in that
escape characters (`\\') are simply another character, except when
preceding the following characters:
    `\\'  double backslashes reduce to one
    `''   incorporates the single quote into the string
    `\n'  suppresses both the backslash and newline character

   Double quote strings are formed according to the rules of string
constants in ANSI-C programs.

   NULL is returned and `errno' will be set to indicate the problem:
   * `EINVAL' - There was an unterminated quoted string.

   * `ENOENT' - The input string was empty.

   * `ENOMEM' - There is not enough memory.

7.6.32.2 configFileLoad
.......................

parse a configuration file

Usage:
    const tOptionValue * res = configFileLoad( fname );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     fname       `char const *' the file to load
     returns     const          An allocated, compound value structure
                 tOptionValue * 

   This routine will load a named configuration file and parse the text
as a hierarchically valued option.  The option descriptor created from
an option definition file is not used via this interface.  The returned
value is "named" with the input file name and is of type
"`OPARG_TYPE_HIERARCHY'".  It may be used in calls to
`optionGetValue()', `optionNextValue()' and `optionUnloadNested()'.

   If the file cannot be loaded or processed, `NULL' is returned and
ERRNO is set.  It may be set by a call to either `open(2)' `mmap(2)' or
other file system calls, or it may be:
   * `ENOENT' - the file was not found.

   * `ENOMSG' - the file was empty.

   * `EINVAL' - the file contents are invalid - not properly formed.

   * `ENOMEM' - not enough memory to allocate the needed structures.

7.6.32.3 optionFileLoad
.......................

Load the locatable config files, in order

Usage:
    int res = optionFileLoad( opts, prog );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     opts        `tOptions *'   program options descriptor
     prog        `char const *' program name
     returns     int            0 -> SUCCESS, -1 -> FAILURE

   This function looks in all the specified directories for a
configuration file ("rc" file or "ini" file) and processes any found
twice.  The first time through, they are processed in reverse order
(last file first).  At that time, only "immediate action" configurables
are processed.  For example, if the last named file specifies not
processing any more configuration files, then no more configuration
files will be processed.  Such an option in the *first* named directory
will have no effect.

   Once the immediate action configurables have been handled, then the
directories are handled in normal, forward order.  In that way, later
config files can override the settings of earlier config files.

   See the AutoOpts documentation for a thorough discussion of the
config file format.

   Configuration files not found or not decipherable are simply ignored.

   Returns the value, "-1" if the program options descriptor is out of
date or indecipherable.  Otherwise, the value "0" will always be
returned.

7.6.32.4 optionFindNextValue
............................

find a hierarcicaly valued option instance

Usage:
    const tOptionValue * res = optionFindNextValue( odesc, pPrevVal, name, value );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     odesc       `const         an option with a nested arg type
                 tOptDesc *'    
     pPrevVal    `const         the last entry
                 tOptionValue   
                 *'             
     name        `char const *' name of value to find
     value       `char const *' the matching value
     returns     const          a compound value structure
                 tOptionValue * 

   This routine will find the next entry in a nested value option or
configurable.  It will search through the list and return the next entry
that matches the criteria.

   The returned result is NULL and errno is set:
   * `EINVAL' - the `pOptValue' does not point to a valid hierarchical
     option value.

   * `ENOENT' - no entry matched the given name.

7.6.32.5 optionFindValue
........................

find a hierarcicaly valued option instance

Usage:
    const tOptionValue * res = optionFindValue( odesc, name, val );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     odesc       `const         an option with a nested arg type
                 tOptDesc *'    
     name        `char const *' name of value to find
     val         `char const *' the matching value
     returns     const          a compound value structure
                 tOptionValue * 

   This routine will find an entry in a nested value option or
configurable.  It will search through the list and return a matching
entry.

   The returned result is NULL and errno is set:
   * `EINVAL' - the `pOptValue' does not point to a valid hierarchical
     option value.

   * `ENOENT' - no entry matched the given name.

7.6.32.6 optionFree
...................

free allocated option processing memory

Usage:
    optionFree( pOpts );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     pOpts       `tOptions *'   program options descriptor

   AutoOpts sometimes allocates memory and puts pointers to it in the
option state structures.  This routine deallocates all such memory.

   As long as memory has not been corrupted, this routine is always
successful.

7.6.32.7 optionGetValue
.......................

get a specific value from a hierarcical list

Usage:
    const tOptionValue * res = optionGetValue( pOptValue, valueName );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     pOptValue   `const         a hierarchcal value
                 tOptionValue   
                 *'             
     valueName   `char const *' name of value to get
     returns     const          a compound value structure
                 tOptionValue * 

   This routine will find an entry in a nested value option or
configurable.  If "valueName" is NULL, then the first entry is
returned.  Otherwise, the first entry with a name that exactly matches
the argument will be returned.  If there is no matching value, NULL is
returned and errno is set to ENOENT. If the provided option value is
not a hierarchical value, NULL is also returned and errno is set to
EINVAL.

   The returned result is NULL and errno is set:
   * `EINVAL' - the `pOptValue' does not point to a valid hierarchical
     option value.

   * `ENOENT' - no entry matched the given name.

7.6.32.8 optionLoadLine
.......................

process a string for an option name and value

Usage:
    optionLoadLine( opts, line );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     opts        `tOptions *'   program options descriptor
     line        `char const *' NUL-terminated text

   This is a client program callable routine for setting options from,
for example, the contents of a file that they read in.  Only one option
may appear in the text.  It will be treated as a normal (non-preset)
option.

   When passed a pointer to the option struct and a string, it will find
the option named by the first token on the string and set the option
argument to the remainder of the string.  The caller must NUL terminate
the string.  The caller need not skip over any introductory hyphens.
Any embedded new lines will be included in the option argument.  If the
input looks like one or more quoted strings, then the input will be
"cooked".  The "cooking" is identical to the string formation used in
AutoGen definition files (*note basic expression::), except that you
may not use backquotes.

   Invalid options are silently ignored.  Invalid option arguments will
cause a warning to print, but the function should return.

7.6.32.9 optionMemberList
.........................

Get the list of members of a bit mask set

Usage:
    char * res = optionMemberList( od );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     od          `tOptDesc *'   the set membership option description
     returns     char *         the names of the set bits

   This converts the OPT_VALUE_name mask value to a allocated string.
It is the caller's responsibility to free the string.

7.6.32.10 optionNextValue
.........................

get the next value from a hierarchical list

Usage:
    const tOptionValue * res = optionNextValue( pOptValue, pOldValue );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     pOptValue   `const         a hierarchcal list value
                 tOptionValue   
                 *'             
     pOldValue   `const         a value from this list
                 tOptionValue   
                 *'             
     returns     const          a compound value structure
                 tOptionValue * 

   This routine will return the next entry after the entry passed in.
At the end of the list, NULL will be returned.  If the entry is not
found on the list, NULL will be returned and "ERRNO" will be set to
EINVAL.  The "POLDVALUE" must have been gotten from a prior call to this
routine or to "`opitonGetValue()'".

   The returned result is NULL and errno is set:
   * `EINVAL' - the `pOptValue' does not point to a valid hierarchical
     option value or `pOldValue' does not point to a member of that
     option value.

   * `ENOENT' - the supplied `pOldValue' pointed to the last entry.

7.6.32.11 optionOnlyUsage
.........................

Print usage text for just the options

Usage:
    optionOnlyUsage( pOpts, ex_code );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     pOpts       `tOptions *'   program options descriptor
     ex_code     `int'          exit code for calling exit(3)

   This routine will print only the usage for each option.  This
function may be used when the emitted usage must incorporate
information not available to AutoOpts.

7.6.32.12 optionPrintVersion
............................

Print the program version

Usage:
    optionPrintVersion( opts, od );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     opts        `tOptions *'   program options descriptor
     od          `tOptDesc *'   the descriptor for this arg

   This routine will print the version to stdout.

7.6.32.13 optionPrintVersionAndReturn
.....................................

Print the program version

Usage:
    optionPrintVersionAndReturn( opts, od );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     opts        `tOptions *'   program options descriptor
     od          `tOptDesc *'   the descriptor for this arg

   This routine will print the version to stdout and return instead of
exiting.  Please see the source for the `print_ver' funtion for details
on selecting how verbose to be after this function returns.

7.6.32.14 optionProcess
.......................

this is the main option processing routine

Usage:
    int res = optionProcess( opts, a_ct, a_v );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     opts        `tOptions *'   program options descriptor
     a_ct        `int'          program arg count
     a_v         `char **'      program arg vector
     returns     int            the count of the arguments processed

   This is the main entry point for processing options.  It is intended
that this procedure be called once at the beginning of the execution of
a program.  Depending on options selected earlier, it is sometimes
necessary to stop and restart option processing, or to select completely
different sets of options.  This can be done easily, but you generally
do not want to do this.

   The number of arguments processed always includes the program name.
If one of the arguments is "-", then it is counted and the processing
stops.  If an error was encountered and errors are to be tolerated, then
the returned value is the index of the argument causing the error.  A
hyphen by itself ("-") will also cause processing to stop and will
_not_ be counted among the processed arguments.  A hyphen by itself is
treated as an operand.  Encountering an operand stops option processing.

   Errors will cause diagnostics to be printed.  `exit(3)' may or may
not be called.  It depends upon whether or not the options were
generated with the "allow-errors" attribute, or if the ERRSKIP_OPTERR
or ERRSTOP_OPTERR macros were invoked.

7.6.32.15 optionRestore
.......................

restore option state from memory copy

Usage:
    optionRestore( pOpts );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     pOpts       `tOptions *'   program options descriptor

   Copy back the option state from saved memory.  The allocated memory
is left intact, so this routine can be called repeatedly without having
to call optionSaveState again.  If you are restoring a state that was
saved before the first call to optionProcess(3AO), then you may change
the contents of the argc/argv parameters to optionProcess.

   If you have not called `optionSaveState' before, a diagnostic is
printed to `stderr' and exit is called.

7.6.32.16 optionSaveFile
........................

saves the option state to a file

Usage:
    optionSaveFile( opts );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     opts        `tOptions *'   program options descriptor

   This routine will save the state of option processing to a file.
The name of that file can be specified with the argument to the
`--save-opts' option, or by appending the `rcfile' attribute to the last
`homerc' attribute.  If no `rcfile' attribute was specified, it will
default to `.programnamerc'.  If you wish to specify another file, you
should invoke the `SET_OPT_SAVE_OPTS(filename)' macro.

   The recommend usage is as follows:
    optionProcess(&progOptions, argc, argv);
    if (i_want_a_non_standard_place_for_this)
    SET_OPT_SAVE_OPTS("myfilename");
    optionSaveFile(&progOptions);

   If no `homerc' file was specified, this routine will silently return
and do nothing.  If the output file cannot be created or updated, a
message will be printed to `stderr' and the routine will return.

7.6.32.17 optionSaveState
.........................

saves the option state to memory

Usage:
    optionSaveState( pOpts );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     pOpts       `tOptions *'   program options descriptor

   This routine will allocate enough memory to save the current option
processing state.  If this routine has been called before, that memory
will be reused.  You may only save one copy of the option state.  This
routine may be called before optionProcess(3AO).  If you do call it
before the first call to optionProcess, then you may also change the
contents of argc/argv after you call optionRestore(3AO)

   In fact, more strongly put: it is safest to only use this function
before having processed any options.  In particular, the saving and
restoring of stacked string arguments and hierarchical values is
disabled.  The values are not saved.

   If it fails to allocate the memory, it will print a message to
stderr and exit.  Otherwise, it will always succeed.

7.6.32.18 optionUnloadNested
............................

Deallocate the memory for a nested value

Usage:
    optionUnloadNested( pOptVal );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     pOptVal     `tOptionValue  the hierarchical value
                 const *'       

   A nested value needs to be deallocated.  The pointer passed in should
have been gotten from a call to `configFileLoad()' (See *note
libopts-configFileLoad::).

7.6.32.19 optionVersion
.......................

return the compiled AutoOpts version number

Usage:
    char const * res = optionVersion();
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     returns     char const *   the version string in constant memory

   Returns the full version string compiled into the library.  The
returned string cannot be modified.

7.6.32.20 strequate
...................

map a list of characters to the same value

Usage:
    strequate( ch_list );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     ch_list     `char const *' characters to equivalence

   Each character in the input string get mapped to the first character
in the string.  This function name is mapped to option_strequate so as
to not conflict with the POSIX name space.

   none.

7.6.32.21 streqvcmp
...................

compare two strings with an equivalence mapping

Usage:
    int res = streqvcmp( str1, str2 );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     str1        `char const *' first string
     str2        `char const *' second string
     returns     int            the difference between two differing
                                characters

   Using a character mapping, two strings are compared for
"equivalence".  Each input character is mapped to a comparison
character and the mapped-to characters are compared for the two NUL
terminated input strings.  This function name is mapped to
option_streqvcmp so as to not conflict with the POSIX name space.

   none checked.  Caller responsible for seg faults.

7.6.32.22 streqvmap
...................

Set the character mappings for the streqv functions

Usage:
    streqvmap( from, to, ct );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     from        `char'         Input character
     to          `char'         Mapped-to character
     ct          `int'          compare length

   Set the character mapping.  If the count (`ct') is set to zero, then
the map is cleared by setting all entries in the map to their index
value.  Otherwise, the "`From'" character is mapped to the "`To'"
character.  If `ct' is greater than 1, then `From' and `To' are
incremented and the process repeated until `ct' entries have been set.
For example,
    streqvmap('a', 'A', 26);
   will alter the mapping so that all English lower case letters will
map to upper case.

   This function name is mapped to option_streqvmap so as to not
conflict with the POSIX name space.

   none.

7.6.32.23 strneqvcmp
....................

compare two strings with an equivalence mapping

Usage:
    int res = strneqvcmp( str1, str2, ct );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     str1        `char const *' first string
     str2        `char const *' second string
     ct          `int'          compare length
     returns     int            the difference between two differing
                                characters

   Using a character mapping, two strings are compared for
"equivalence".  Each input character is mapped to a comparison
character and the mapped-to characters are compared for the two NUL
terminated input strings.  The comparison is limited to `ct' bytes.
This function name is mapped to option_strneqvcmp so as to not conflict
with the POSIX name space.

   none checked.  Caller responsible for seg faults.

7.6.32.24 strtransform
......................

convert a string into its mapped-to value

Usage:
    strtransform( dest, src );
   Where the arguments are:
     Name        Type           Description
     ----        ----           ------------
     dest        `char *'       output string
     src         `char const *' input string

   Each character in the input string is mapped and the mapped-to
character is put into the output.  This function name is mapped to
option_strtransform so as to not conflict with the POSIX name space.

   The source and destination may be the same.

   none.

7.7 Multi-Threading
===================

AutoOpts was designed to configure a program for running.  This
generally happens before much real work has been started.
Consequently, it is expected to be run before multi-threaded
applications have started multiple threads.  However, this is not
always the case. Some applications may need to reset and reload their
running configuration, and some may use `SET_OPT_xxx()' macros during
processing.  If you need to dynamically change your option
configuration in your multi-threaded application, it is your
responsibility to prevent all threads from accessing the option
configuration state, except the one altering the configuration.

   The various accessor macros (`HAVE_OPT()', etc.) do not modify state
and are safe to use in a multi-threaded application.  It is safe as long
as no other thread is concurrently modifying state, of course.

7.8 Option Descriptor File
==========================

This is the module that is to be compiled and linked with your program.
It contains internal data and procedures subject to change.  Basically,
it contains a single global data structure containing all the
information provided in the option definitions, plus a number of static
strings and any callout procedures that are specified or required.  You
should never have need for looking at this, except, perhaps, to examine
the code generated for implementing the `flag-code' construct.

7.9 Using AutoOpts
==================

There are actually several levels of `using' autoopts.  Which you
choose depends upon how you plan to distribute (or not) your
application.

7.9.1 local-only use
--------------------

To use AutoOpts in your application where you do not have to worry
about distribution issues, your issues are simple and few.

   * Create a file `myopts.def', according to the documentation above.
     It is probably easiest to start with the example in *note Quick
     Start:: and edit it into the form you need.

   * Run AutoGen to create the option interface file (`myopts.h') and
     the option descriptor code (`myopts.c'):

         autogen myopts.def

   * In all your source files where you need to refer to option state,
     `#include "myopts.h"'.

   * In your main routine, code something along the lines of:

         #define ARGC_MIN some-lower-limit
         #define ARGC_MAX some-upper-limit
         main( int argc, char** argv )
         {
             {
                 int arg_ct = optionProcess( &myprogOptions, argc, argv );
                 argc -= arg_ct;
                 if ((argc < ARGC_MIN) || (argc > ARGC_MAX)) {
                     fprintf( stderr, "%s ERROR:  remaining args (%d) "
                              "out of range\n", myprogOptions.pzProgName,
                              argc );

                     USAGE( EXIT_FAILURE );
                 }
                 argv += arg_ct;
             }
             if (HAVE_OPT(OPTN_NAME))
                 respond_to_optn_name();
             ...
         }

   * Compile `myopts.c' and link your program with the following
     additional arguments:

         `autoopts-config cflags ldflags` myopts.c

7.9.2 binary distro, AutoOpts not installed
-------------------------------------------

If you will be distributing (or copying) your project to a system that
does not have AutoOpts installed, you will need to statically link the
AutoOpts library, `libopts' into your program.  Get the link information
with `static-libs' instead of `ldflags':

    `autoopts-config static-libs`

7.9.3 binary distro, AutoOpts pre-installed
-------------------------------------------

If you will be distributing (or copying) your project to a system that
does have AutoOpts (or only `libopts') installed, you will still need to
ensure that the library is findable at program load time, or you will
still have to statically link.  The former can be accomplished by
linking your project with `--rpath' or by setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH'
appropriately.  Otherwise, *Note binary not installed::.

7.9.4 source distro, AutoOpts pre-installed
-------------------------------------------

If you will be distributing your project to a system that will build
your product but it may not be pre-installed with AutoOpts, you will
need to do some configuration checking before you start the build.
Assuming you are willing to fail the build if AutoOpts has not been
installed, you will still need to do a little work.

   AutoOpts is distributed with a configuration check M4 script,
`autoopts.m4'.  It will add an `autoconf' macro named,
`AG_PATH_AUTOOPTS'.  Add this to your `configure.ac' script and use the
following substitution values:

`AUTOGEN'
     the name of the autogen executable

`AUTOGEN_TPLIB'
     the directory where AutoGen template library is stored

`AUTOOPTS_CFLAGS'
     the compile time options needed to find the AutoOpts headers

`AUTOOPTS_LIBS'
     the link options required to access the `libopts' library

7.9.5 source distro, AutoOpts not installed
-------------------------------------------

If you will be distributing your project to a system that will build
your product but it may not be pre-installed with AutoOpts, you may
wish to incorporate the sources for `libopts' in your project.  To do
this, I recommend reading the tear-off libopts library `README' that
you can find in the `pkg/libopts' directory.  You can also examine an
example package (blocksort) that incorporates this tear off library in
the autogen distribution directory.  There is also a web page that
describes what you need to do:
    `http://autogen.sourceforge.net/blocksort.html'

   Alternatively, you can pull the `libopts' library sources into a
build directory and build it for installation along with your package.
This can be done approximately as follows:
    tar -xzvf `autoopts-config libsrc`
    cd libopts-*
    ./bootstrap
    configure
    make
    make install
   That will install the library, but not the headers or anything else.

7.10 Configuring your program
=============================

AutoOpts supports the notion of `presetting' the value or state of an
option.  The values may be obtained either from environment variables
or from configuration files (`rc' or `ini' files).  In order to take
advantage of this, the AutoOpts client program must specify these
features in the option descriptor file (*note program attributes::)
with the `rcfile' or `environrc' attributes.

   It is also possible to configure your program without using the
command line option parsing code.  This is done by using only the
following four functions from the `libopts' library:

`configFileLoad'
     (*note libopts-configFileLoad::) will parse the contents of a
     config file and return a pointer to a structure representing the
     hierarchical value.  The values are sorted alphabetically by the
     value name and all entries with the same name will retain their
     original order.  Insertion sort is used.

`optionGetValue'
     (*note libopts-optionGetValue::) will find the first value within
     the hierarchy with a name that matches the name passed in.

`optionNextValue'
     (*note libopts-optionNextValue::) will return the next value that
     follows the value passed in as an argument.  If you wish to get all
     the values for a particular name, you must take note when the name
     changes.

`optionUnloadNested'
     (*note libopts-optionUnloadNested::).  The pointer passed in must
     be of type, `OPARG_TYPE_HIERARCHY' (see the autoopts/options.h
     header file).  `configFileLoad' will return a `tOptionValue'
     pointer of that type.  This function will release all the
     associated memory.  `AutoOpts' generated code uses this function
     for its own needs.  Client code should only call this function
     with pointers gotten from `configFileLoad'.

7.10.1 configuration file presets
---------------------------------

Configuration files are enabled by specifying the program attribute
`homerc' (*note program attributes::).  Any option not marked with the
`no-preset' attribute may appear in a configuration file.  The files
loaded are selected both by the `homerc' entries and, optionally, via a
command line option.  The first component of the `homerc' entry may be
an environment variable such as `$HOME', or it may also be `$$' (*two*
dollar sign characters) to specify the directory of the executable.
For example:

    homerc = "$$/../share/autogen";

will cause the AutoOpts library to look in the normal autogen datadir
relative to the current installation directory for autogen.

   The configuration files are processed in the order they are
specified by the `homerc' attribute, so that each new file will
normally override the settings of the previous files.  This may be
overridden by marking some options for `immediate action' (*note
Immediate Action::).  Any such options are acted upon in *reverse*
order.  The disabled `load-opts' (`--no-load-opts') option, for
example, is an immediate action option.  Its presence in the last
`homerc' file will prevent the processing of any prior `homerc' files
because its effect is immediate.

   Configuration file processing can be completely suppressed by
specifying `--no-load-opts' on the command line, or
`PROGRAM_LOAD_OPTS=no' in the environment (if `environrc' has been
specified).

   See the `Configuration File Format' section (*note Config File
Format::) for details on the format of the file.

7.10.2 Saving the presets into a configuration file
---------------------------------------------------

When configuration files are enabled for an application, the user is
also provided with an automatically supplied `--save-opts' option.  All
of the known option state will be written to either the specified
output file or, if it is not specified, then to the last specified
`homerc' file.

7.10.3 Creating a sample configuration file
-------------------------------------------

AutoOpts is shipped with a template named, `rc-sample.tpl'.  If your
option definition file specifies the `homerc' attribute, then you may
invoke `autogen' thus:

    autogen -Trc-sample <your-option-def-file>

   This will, by default, produce a sample file named,
`sample-<prog-name>rc'.  It will be named differently if you specify
your configuration (rc) file name with the `rcfile' attribute.  In that
case, the output file will be named, `sample-<rcfile-name>'.  It will
contain all of the program options not marked as `no-preset'.  It will
also include the text from the `doc' attribute.

Doing so with getdefs' option definitions yields this sample-getdefsrc
file.  I tend to be wordy in my `doc' attributes:

    # defs_to_get -- Regexp to look for after the "/*="
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # If you want definitions only from a particular category, or even
    # with names matching particular patterns, then specify this regular
    # expression for the text that must follow the @code{/*=}.
    # Example:
    #
    #defs_to_get	reg-ex

    # subblock -- subblock definition names
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # This option is used to create shorthand entries for nested definitions.
    # For example, with:
    # @table @r
    # @item using subblock thus
    # @code{--subblock=arg=argname,type,null}
    # @item and defining an @code{arg} thus
    # @code{arg: this, char *}
    # @item will then expand to:
    # @code{arg = @{ argname = this; type = "char *"; @};}
    # @end table
    # The "this, char *" string is separated at the commas, with the
    # white space removed.  You may use characters other than commas by
    # starting the value string with a punctuation character other than
    # a single or double quote character.  You may also omit intermediate
    # values by placing the commas next to each other with no intervening
    # white space.  For example, "+mumble++yes+" will expand to:
    # @*
    # @code{arg = @{ argname = mumble; null = "yes"; @};}.
    # Example:
    #
    #subblock	sub-def

    # listattr -- attribute with list of values
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # This option is used to create shorthand entries for definitions
    # that generally appear several times.  That is, they tend to be
    # a list of values.  For example, with:
    # @*
    # @code{listattr=foo} defined, the text:
    # @*
    # @code{foo: this, is, a, multi-list} will then expand to:
    # @*
    # @code{foo = 'this', 'is', 'a', 'multi-list';}
    # @*
    # The texts are separated by the commas, with the
    # white space removed.  You may use characters other than commas by
    # starting the value string with a punctuation character other than
    # a single or double quote character.
    # Example:
    #
    #listattr	def

    # ordering -- Alphabetize or use named file
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # By default, ordering is alphabetical by the entry name.  Use,
    # @code{no-ordering} if order is unimportant.  Use @code{ordering}
    # with no argument to order without case sensitivity.  Use
    # @code{ordering=<file-name>} if chronological order is important.
    # getdefs will maintain the text content of @code{file-name}.
    # @code{file-name} need not exist.
    # Example:
    #
    #ordering	file-name

    # first_index -- The first index to apply to groups
    #
    # This configuration value takes an integer number as its argument.
    #
    #
    # By default, the first occurrence of a named definition will have an
    # index of zero.  Sometimes, that needs to be a reserved value.  Provide
    # this option to specify a different starting point.
    # Example:
    #
    #first_index	0

    # filelist -- Insert source file names into defs
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # Inserts the name of each input file into the output definitions.
    # If no argument is supplied, the format will be:
    # @example
    # infile = '%s';
    # @end example
    # If an argument is supplied, that string will be used for the entry
    # name instead of @var{infile}.
    # Example:
    #
    #filelist	file

    # assign -- Global assignments
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # The argument to each copy of this option will be inserted into
    # the output definitions, with only a semicolon attached.
    # Example:
    #
    #assign	ag-def

    # common_assign -- Assignments common to all blocks
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # The argument to each copy of this option will be inserted into
    # each output definition, with only a semicolon attached.
    # Example:
    #
    #common_assign	ag-def

    # copy -- File(s) to copy into definitions
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # The content of each file named by these options will be inserted into
    # the output definitions.
    # Example:
    #
    #copy	file

    # srcfile -- Insert source file name into each def
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # Inserts the name of the input file where a definition was found
    # into the output definition.
    # If no argument is supplied, the format will be:
    # @example
    # srcfile = '%s';
    # @end example
    # If an argument is supplied, that string will be used for the entry
    # name instead of @var{srcfile}.
    # Example:
    #
    #srcfile	file

    # linenum -- Insert source line number into each def
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # Inserts the line number in the input file where a definition
    # was found into the output definition.
    # If no argument is supplied, the format will be:
    # @example
    # linenum = '%s';
    # @end example
    # If an argument is supplied, that string will be used for the entry
    # name instead of @var{linenum}.
    # Example:
    #
    #linenum	def-name

    # input -- Input file to search for defs
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # All files that are to be searched for definitions must be named on
    # the command line or read from @code{stdin}.  If there is only one
    # @code{input} option and it is the string, "-", then the input file
    # list is read from @code{stdin}.  If a command line argument is not
    # an option name and does not contain an assignment operator
    # (@code{=}), then it defaults to being an input file name.
    # At least one input file must be specified.
    # Example:
    #
    #input	src-file

    # output -- Output file to open
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # If you are not sending the output to an AutoGen process,
    # you may name an output file instead.
    # Example:
    #
    #output	file

    # autogen -- Invoke AutoGen with defs
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # This is the default output mode.  Specifying @code{no-autogen} is
    # equivalent to @code{output=-}.  If you supply an argument to this
    # option, that program will be started as if it were AutoGen and
    # its standard in will be set to the output definitions of this program.
    # Example:
    #
    #autogen	ag-cmd

    # template -- Template Name
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # Specifies the template name to be used for generating the final output.
    # Example:
    #
    #template	file

    # agarg -- AutoGen Argument
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # This is a pass-through argument.  It allows you to specify any
    # arbitrary argument to be passed to AutoGen.
    # Example:
    #
    #agarg	ag-opt

    # base_name -- Base name for output file(s)
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # When output is going to AutoGen, a base name must either be supplied
    # or derived.  If this option is not supplied, then it is taken from
    # the @code{template} option.  If that is not provided either, then
    # it is set to the base name of the current directory.
    # Example:
    #
    #base_name	name

7.10.4 environment variable presets
-----------------------------------

If the AutoOpts client program specifies `environrc' in its option
descriptor file, then environment variables will be used for presetting
option state.  Variables will be looked for that are named,
`PROGRAM_OPTNAME' and `PROGRAM'.  `PROGRAM' is the upper cased `C-name'
of the program, and OPTNAME is the upper cased `C-name' of a specific
option.  (The `C-name's are the regular names with all special
characters converted to underscores (`_').)

   Option specific environment variables are processed after (and thus
take precedence over) the contents of the `PROGRAM' environment
variable.  The option argument string for these options takes on the
string value gotten from the environment.  Consequently, you can only
have one instance of the OPTNAME.

   If a particular option may be disabled, then its disabled state is
indicated by setting the `PROGRAM_OPTNAME' value to the disablement
prefix.  So, for example, if the disablement prefix were `dont', then
you can disable the `optname' option by setting the `PROGRAM_OPTNAME''
environment variable to `dont'.  *Note Common Attributes::.

   The `PROGRAM' environment string is tokenized and parsed much like a
command line.  Doubly quoted strings have backslash escapes processed
the same way they are processed in C program constant strings.  Singly
quoted strings are pretty raw in that backslashes are honored before
other backslashes, apostrophes, newlines and cr/newline pairs.  The
options must be introduced with hyphens in the same way as the command
line.

   Note that not all options may be preset.  Options that are specified
with the `no-preset' attribute and the `--help', `--more-help', and
`--save-opts' auto-supported options may not be preset.

7.10.5 Config file only example
-------------------------------

If for some reason it is difficult or unworkable to integrate
configuration file processing with command line option parsing, the
`libopts' (*note libopts procedures::) library can still be used to
process configuration files.  Below is a Hello, World! greeting program
that tries to load a configuration file `hello.conf' to see if it
should use an alternate greeting or to personalize the salutation.
    #include <config.h>
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <pwd.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #ifdef   HAVE_UNISTD_H
    #include <unistd.h>
    #endif
    #include <autoopts/options.h>
    int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
      char const * greeting = "Hello";
      char const * greeted  = "World";
      tOptionValue const * pOV = configFileLoad("hello.conf");

      if (pOV != NULL) {
        const tOptionValue* pGetV = optionGetValue(pOV, "greeting");

        if (  (pGetV != NULL)
           && (pGetV->valType == OPARG_TYPE_STRING))
          greeting = strdup(pGetV->v.strVal);

        pGetV = optionGetValue(pOV, "personalize");
        if (pGetV != NULL) {
          struct passwd * pwe = getpwuid(getuid());
          if (pwe != NULL)
            greeted = strdup(pwe->pw_gecos);
        }

        optionUnloadNested(pOV); /* deallocate config data */
      }
      printf("%s, %s!\n", greeting, greeted);
      return 0;
    }

With that text in a file named "hello.c", this short script:

    cc -o hello hello.c `autoopts-config cflags ldflags`
    ./hello
    echo 'greeting Buzz off' > hello.conf
    ./hello
    echo personalize > hello.conf
    ./hello

will produce the following output:

    Hello, World!
    Buzz off, World!
    Hello, Bruce Korb!

7.11 Configuration File Format
==============================

The configuration file is designed to associate names and values, much
like an AutoGen Definition File (*note Definitions File::).
Unfortunately, the file formats are different.  Specifically, AutoGen
Definitions provide for simpler methods for the precise control of a
value string and provides for dynamically computed content.
Configuration files have some established traditions in their layout.
So, they are different, even though they do both allow for a single
name to be associated with multiple values and they both allow for
hierarchical values.

7.11.1 assigning a string value to a configurable
-------------------------------------------------

The basic syntax is a name followed by a value on a single line.  They
are separated from each other by either white space, a colon (`:') or an
equal sign (`=').  The colon or equal sign may optionally be surrounded
by additional white space.  If more than one value line is needed, a
backslash (`\') may be used to continue the value.  The backslash (but
not the newline) will be erased.  Leading and trailing white space is
always stripped from the value.

   Fundamentally, it looks like this:

    name  value for that name
    name = another \
         multi-line value \
         for that name.
    name: a *third* value for `name'

   If you need more control over the content of the value, you may
enclose the value in XML style brackets:
    <name>value </name>
   Within these brackets you need not (must not) continue the value
data with backslashes.  You may also select the string formation rules
to use, just add the attribute after the name, thus: `<name keep>'.

`keep'
     This mode will keep all text between the brackets and not strip any
     white space.

`uncooked'
     This mode strips leading and trailing white space, but not do any
     quote processing.  This is the default and need not be specified.

`cooked'
     The text is trimmed of leading and trailing white space and XML
     encodings are processed.  These encodings are slightly expanded
     over the XML specification.  They are specified with an ampersand
     followed by a value name or numeric value and then a semicolon:

    `amp'
    `lt'
    `gt'
    `quot'
    `apos'
    `#dd'
    `#xHH'
          These are all per fairly standad HTML and/or XML encodings.
          Additionally:

    `bs'
          The ASCII back space character.

    `ff'
          The ASCII form feed character.

    `ht'
          The ASCII horizontal (normal) tab character.

    `cr'
          The ASCII carriage return character.

    `vt'
          The ASCII vertical tab character.

    `bel'
          The ASCII alarm bell character.

    `nl'
          The ASCII new line character.

    `space'
          The ASCII space character.  Normally not necessary, but if
          you want to preserve leading or trailing space characters,
          then use this.

   And here is an example of an XML-styled value:

    <name cooked>
        This is&nl;&ht;another multi-line
    &ht;string example.
    </name>

   The string value associated with `name' will be exactly the text
enclosed in quotes with the encoded characters `cooked' as you would
expect (three text lines with the last line not ending with a newline,
but ending with a period).

7.11.2 integer values
---------------------

A name can be specified as having an integer value.  To do this, you
must use the XML-ish format and specify a `type' attribute for the name:

    <name type=integer> 1234 </name>

   Boolean, enumeration and set membership types will be added as time
allows.  `type=string' is also supported, but also is the default.

7.11.3 hierarchical values
--------------------------

In order to specify a hierarchical value, you *must* use XML-styled
formatting, specifying a type that is shorter and easier to spell:

    <structured-name type=nested>
        [[....]]
    </structured-name>

The ellipsis may be filled with any legal configuration file name/value
assignments.

7.11.4 configuration file directives
------------------------------------

The `<?' marker indicates an XML directive.  There is only one
directive supported:  program sectioning, though two syntaxes are
supported.

   If, for example, you have a collection of programs that work closely
together and, likely, have a common set of options, these programs may
use a single, sectioned, configuration file.  The file may be sectioned
in either of two ways.  The two ways may not be intermixed in a single
configuration file.  All text before the first segmentation line is
processed, then only the segment that applies:

`<?auto-options ...>'
     The `...' ellipsis may contain AutoOpts option processing options.
     Currently, that consists of one or both of:

    `gnu'
    `autoopts'
          to indicate GNU-standard or AutoOpts-standard layout of usage
          and version information, and/or

    `misuse-usage'
    `no-misuse-usage'
          to indicate whether the available options should be listed
          when an invalid option appears on the command line.
     Anything else will be silently ignored.

`<?program prog-name>'
     The `<?' marker indicates an XML directive.  The file is
     partitioned by these lines and the options are processed for the
     `prog-name' program only before the first `<?program' directive
     and the program section with a matching program name.

`[PROG_NAME]'
     This is basically an alias for `<?program prog-name>', except that
     the program name must be upper cased and segmented only with
     underscores.

Segmentation does not apply if the config file is being parsed with the
`configFileLoad(3AutoOpts)' function.

7.11.5 comments in the configuration file
-----------------------------------------

Comments are lines beginning with a hash mark (`#'), XML-style comments
(`<!-- arbitrary text -->'), and unrecognized XML directives.

    # this is a comment
    <!-- this is also
         a comment -->
    <?this is
      a bad comment ;->

7.12 AutoOpts for Shell Scripts
===============================

AutoOpts may be used with shell scripts either by automatically
creating a complete program that will process command line options and
pass back the results to the invoking shell by issuing shell variable
assignment commands, or it may be used to generate portable shell code
that can be inserted into your script.

   The functionality of these features, of course, is somewhat
constrained compared with the normal program facilities.  Specifically,
you cannot invoke callout procedures with either of these methods.
Additionally, if you generate a shell script to do the parsing:

  1. You cannot obtain options from configuration files.

  2. You cannot obtain options from environment variables.

  3. You cannot save the option state to an option file.

  4. Option conflict/requirement verification is disabled.

   Both of these methods are enabled by running AutoGen on the
definitions file with the additional main procedure attribute:

    main = { main-type = shell-process; };
   or:
    main = { main-type = shell-parser; };

   If you do not supply a `proc-to-call', it will default to
`optionPutShell'.  That will produce a program that will process the
options and generate shell text for the invoking shell to interpret
(*note binary-parser::).  If you supply the name, `optionParseShell',
then you will have a program that will generate a shell script that can
parse the options (*note script-parser::).  If you supply a different
procedure name, you will have to provide that routine and it may do
whatever you like.

7.12.1 Parsing with an Executable
---------------------------------

The following commands are approximately all that is needed to build a
shell script command line option parser from an option definition file:

    autogen -L <opt-template-dir> test-errors.def
    cc -o test-errors -L <opt-lib-dir> -I <opt-include-dir> \
            -DTEST_PROGRAM_OPTS test-errors.c -lopts

   The resulting program can then be used within your shell script as
follows:

    eval `./test-errors "$@"`
    if [ -z "${OPTION_CT}" ] ; then exit 1 ; fi
    test ${OPTION_CT} -gt 0 && shift ${OPTION_CT}

   Here is the usage output example from AutoOpts error handling tests.
The option definition has argument reordering enabled:

    test_errors - Test AutoOpts for errors
    Usage:  errors [ -<flag> [<val>] | --<name>[{=| }<val>] ]... arg ...
      Flg Arg Option-Name    Description
       -o no  option         The option option descrip
       -s Str second         The second option descrip
                                    - may appear up to 10 times
       -i --- ignored        we have dumped this
       -X no  another        Another option descrip
                                    - may appear up to 5 times
       -? no  help           display extended usage information and exit
       -! no  more-help      extended usage information passed thru pager
       -> opt save-opts      save the option state to a config file
       -< Str load-opts      load options from a config file
                                    - disabled as '--no-load-opts'
                                    - may appear multiple times

    Options are specified by doubled hyphens and their name or by a single
    hyphen and the flag character.
    Operands and options may be intermixed.  They will be reordered.

    The following option preset mechanisms are supported:
     - reading file errorsRC

    Report test_errors bugs to bkorb@gnu.org

   Using the invocation,
      test-errors operand1 -s first operand2 -X -- -s operand3
   you get the following output for your shell script to evaluate:

    OPTION_CT=4
    export OPTION_CT
    TEST_ERRORS_SECOND='first'
    export TEST_ERRORS_SECOND
    TEST_ERRORS_ANOTHER=1 # 0x1
    export TEST_ERRORS_ANOTHER
    set -- 'operand1' 'operand2' '-s' 'operand3'
    OPTION_CT=0

7.12.2 Parsing with a Portable Script
-------------------------------------

If you had used `test-main = optionParseShell' instead, then you can,
at this point, merely run the program and it will write the parsing
script to standard out.  You may also provide this program with command
line options to specify the shell script file to create or edit, and you
may specify the shell program to use on the first shell script line.
That program's usage text would look something like the following and
the script parser itself would be very verbose:

    genshellopt - Generate Shell Option Processing Script - Ver. 1
    Usage:  genshellopt [ -<flag> [<val>] | --<name>[{=| }<val>] ]...
      Flg Arg Option-Name    Description
       -o Str script         Output Script File
       -s Str shell          Shell name (follows "#!" magic)
                                    - disabled as '--no-shell'
                                    - enabled by default
       -v opt version        output version information and exit
       -? no  help           display extended usage information and exit
       -! no  more-help      extended usage information passed thru pager

    Options are specified by doubled hyphens and their name or by a single
    hyphen and the flag character.
    Note that 'shell' is only useful if the output file does not already exist.
    If it does, then the shell name and optional first argument will be
    extracted from the script file.
    If the script file already exists and contains Automated Option Processing
    text, the second line of the file through the ending tag will be replaced
    by the newly generated text.  The first '#!' line will be regenerated.

7.13 Automated Info Docs
========================

AutoOpts provides two templates for producing `.texi' documentation.
`agtexi-cmd.tpl' for the invoking section, and `aginfo3.tpl' for
describing exported library functions and macros.

   For both types of documents, the documentation level is selected by
passing a `-DLEVEL=<level-name>' argument to AutoGen when you build the
document.  (See the example invocation below.)

   Two files will be produced, a `.texi' file and a `.menu' file.  You
should include the text in the `.menu' file in a `@menu' list, either
with `@include'-ing it or just copying text.  The `.texi' file should
be `@include'-ed where the invoking section belongs in your document.

   The `.texi' file will contain an introductory paragraph, a menu and
a subordinate section for the invocation usage and for each documented
option.  The introductory paragraph is normally the boiler plate text,
along the lines of:

    This chapter documents the @file{AutoOpts} generated usage text
    and option meanings for the @file{your-program} program.

or:

    These are the publicly exported procedures from the libname library.
    Any other functions mentioned in the header file are for the private use
    of the library.

7.13.1 `invoking' info docs
---------------------------

Using the option definitions for an AutoOpt client program, the
`agtexi-cmd.tpl' template will produce texinfo text that documents the
invocation of your program.  The text emitted is designed to be included
in the full texinfo document for your product.  It is not a stand-alone
document.  The usage text for the *note autogen usage::, *note getdefs
usage:: and *note columns usage:: programs, are included in this
document and are all generated using this template.

   If your program's option definitions include a `prog-info-descrip'
section, then that text will replace the boilerplate introductory
paragraph.

These files are produced by invoking the following command:

    autogen -L ${prefix}/share/autogen -Tagtexi-cmd.tpl \
            -DLEVEL=section your-opts.def

Where `${prefix}' is the AutoGen installation prefix and
`your-opts.def' is the name of your product's option definition file.

7.13.2 library info docs
------------------------

The `texinfo' doc for libraries is derived from mostly the same
information as is used for producing man pages *Note man3::.  The main
difference is that there is only one output file and the individual
functions are referenced from a `texi' menu.  There is also a small
difference in the global attributes used:

  lib_description   A description of the library.  This text
                    appears before the menu.  If not provided, the
                    standard boilerplate version will be inserted.

  see_also          The `SEE ALSO' functionality is not supported
                    for the `texinfo' documentation, so any
                    `see_also' attribute will be ignored.

These files are produced by invoking the following commands:

    getdefs linenum srcfile template=aginfo3.tpl output=libexport.def \
           <source-file-list>

    autogen -L ${prefix}/share/autogen -DLEVEL=section libexport.def

Where `${prefix}' is the AutoGen installation prefix and
`libexport.def' is some name that suits you.

   An example of this can be seen in this document, *Note libopts
procedures::.

7.14 Automated Man Pages
========================

AutoOpts provides two templates for producing man pages.  The command
(`man1') pages are derived from the options definition file, and the
library (`man3') pages are derived from stylized comments (*note
getdefs Invocation::).

   Man pages include a date in the footer.  By default, this is derived
from the current date.  However, this may be overridden with the
`MAN_PAGE_DATE' environment variable.  If set and not empty, its
contents will be copied into where the output of `date '+%d %b %Y''
would otherwise go.

   Man pages may be formatted as either traditional man pages or using
`mdoc' formatting.  The format is selected by selecting the appropriate
template.

7.14.1 command line man pages
-----------------------------

Man pages for commands are documented using the `agman-cmd.tpl' and
`agmdoc-cmd.tpl' templates.  If the options specify pulling information
from `RC'/`ini'/`cfg' files, then you may use the `rc-sample.tpl'
template to produce an example config file for your program.

   Using the option definitions for an AutoOpts client program, the
`agman-cmd.tpl' template will produce an nroff document suitable for
use as a `man(1)' page document for a command line command.  The
description section of the document is either the `prog-man-descrip'
text, if present, or the `detail' text.

   Each option in the option definitions file is fully documented in
its usage.  This includes all the information documented above for each
option (*note option attributes::), plus the `doc' attribute is
appended.  Since the `doc' text is presumed to be designed for
`texinfo' documentation, `sed' is used to convert some constructs from
`texi' to `nroff'-for-`man'-pages.  Specifically,

    convert @code, @var and @samp into \fB...\fP phrases
    convert @file into \fI...\fP phrases
    Remove the '@' prefix from curly braces
    Indent example regions
    Delete the example commands
    Replace `end example' command with ".br"
    Replace the `@*' command with ".br"

This document is produced by invoking the following command:

    autogen -L ${prefix}/share/autogen -Tagman-cmd.tpl options.def

Where `${prefix}' is the AutoGen installation prefix and `options.def'
is the name of your product's option definition file.  I do not use
this very much, so any feedback or improvements would be greatly
appreciated.

7.14.2 library man pages
------------------------

Man pages for libraries are documented using the `agman3.tpl' template.

   Two global definitions are required, and then one library man page
is produced for each `export_func' definition that is found.  It is
generally convenient to place these definitions as `getdefs' comments
(*note getdefs Invocation::) near the procedure definition, but they
may also be a separate AutoGen definitions file (*note Definitions
File::).  Each function will be cross referenced with their sister
functions in a `SEE ALSO' section.  A global `see_also' definition will
be appended to this cross referencing text.

The two global definitions required are:

  library     This is the name of your library, without the `lib'
              prefix.  The AutoOpts library is named
              `libopts.so...', so the `library' attribute would have
              the value `opts'.

  header      Generally, using a library with a compiled program
              entails `#include'-ing a header file.  Name that
              header with this attribute.  In the case of AutoOpts,
              it is generated and will vary based on the name of the
              option definition file.  Consequently, `your-opts.h' is
              specified.

The `export_func' definition should contain the following attributes:

  name        The name of the procedure the library user may call.
  what        A brief sentence describing what the procedure does.
  doc         A detailed description of what the procedure does.  It
              may ramble on for as long as necessary to properly
              describe it.
  err         A short description of how errors are handled.
  ret_type    The data type returned by the procedure.  Omit this
              for `void' procedures.
  ret_desc    Describe what the returned value is, if needed.
  private     If specified, the function will *not* be documented.
              This is used, for example, to produce external
              declarations for functions that are not available for
              public use, but are used in the generated text.

  arg         This is a compound attribute that contains:

              arg_type    The data type of the argument.
              arg_name    A short name for it.
              arg_desc    A brief description.

As a `getdefs' comment, this would appear something like this:

    /*=--subblock=arg=arg_type,arg_name,arg_desc =*/

Note the `subblock' and `library' comments.  `subblock' is an embedded
`getdefs' option (*note getdefs subblock::) that tells it how to parse
the `arg' attribute.  The `library' and `header' entries are global
definitions that apply to all the documented functions.

7.15 Using getopt(3C)
=====================

There is a template named, `getopt.tpl' that is distributed with
AutoOpts.  Using that template instead of `options.tpl' will produce
completely independent source code that will parse command line
options.  It will utilize either the standard `getopt(3C)' or the GNU
`getopt_long(3GNU)' function to drive the parsing.  Which is used is
selected by the presence or absence of the `long-opts' program
attribute.  It will save you from being dependent upon the `libopts'
library and it produces code ready for internationalization.  However,
it also carries with it some limitations on the use of AutoOpts
features and some requirements on the build environment.

   *PLEASE NOTE*: in processing the option definitions to produce the
usage text, it is necessary to compile some generated code in a
temporary directory.  That means that all the include directories
needed to compile the code must be full path names and not relative
directory names.  "." is a relative directory name.  To specify "-I."
in the `CFLAGS' environment variable, you must expand it.  For example,
use:
    CFLAGS=-I`pwd`

7.15.1 getopt feature limitations
---------------------------------

This list of limitations is relative to the full list of AutoOpts
supported features, *Note Features::.

  1. You cannot automatically take advantage of environment variable
     options or automated parsing of configuration files (`rc' or `ini'
     files).  Consequently, the resulting code does not support
     `--load-opts' or `--save-opts' options automatically.

  2. You cannot use set membership, enumerated, range checked or stacked
     argument type options.  In fact, you cannot use anything that
     depends upon the `libopts' library.  You are constrained to
     options that take ``string'' arguments, though you may handle the
     option argument with a callback procedure.

  3. Special disablement and/or enablement prefixes are not recognized.

  4. Option coordination with external libraries will not work.

  5. Every option must be `settable' because the emitted code depends
     upon the `SET_OPT_XXX' macros having been defined.  Specify this
     as a global (program) attribute.

  6. You must specify a main procedure attribute (*note Generated
     main::).  The `getopt.tpl' template depends upon being able to
     compile the traditional .c file into a program and get it to emit
     the usage text.

  7. For the same reason, the traditional option parsing table code
     must be emitted before the `getopt.tpl' template gets expanded.

  8. The usage text is, therefore, statically defined.

7.15.2 getopt build requirements
--------------------------------

You must supply some compile and link options via environment variables.

`srcdir'
     In case the option definition file lives in a different directory.

`CFLAGS'
     Any special flags required to compile.  The flags from
     `autoopts-config cflags' will be included automatically.  Since
     the creation of the option parsing code includes creating a program
     that prints out help text, if it is necessary to include files from
     various directories to compile that program, you will need to
     specify those directories with `-Idirpath' text in the `CFLAGS'.
     Some experimentation may be necessary in that case.

     *NOTE*: the `-Idirpath' text is only needed if your option
     callback functions include code that require additional `#include'
     directives.

`LDFLAGS'
     Any special flags required to link.  The flags from
     `autoopts-config ldflags' will be included automatically.  This is
     required only if additional link flags for the help text emission
     program might be needed.

`CC'
     This is needed only if ``cc'' cannot be found in `$PATH' (or it is
     not the one you want).

   To use this, set the exported environment variables and specify
`getopt' as the default template in your option definitions file (*note
Identification::).  You will have four new files.  Assuming your
definitions were in a file named `myprog-opts.def' and your program name
was specified as `progname', the resulting files would be created:
`myprog-opts.h', `myprog-opts.c', `getopt-progname.h' and
`getopt-progname.c'.  You must compile and link both `.c' files into
your program.  If there are link failures, then you are using AutoOpts
features that require the `libopts' library.  You must remove these
features, *Note getopt limitations::.

   These generated files depend upon configure defines to work
correctly.  Therefore, you must specify a `config-header' attribute
(*note programming attributes::) and ensure it has `#defines' for
either `HAVE_STDINT_H' or `HAVE_INTTYPES_H'; either `HAVE_SYS_LIMITS_H'
or `HAVE_LIMITS_H'; and `HAVE_SYSEXITS_H', if the `sysexits.h' header
is available.  The required header files for these defines are,
respectively, the `/usr/include' files named:
   * stdint.h

   * inttypes.h

   * sys/limits.h

   * limits.h

   * sysexits.h

The following header files must also exist on the build platform:
   * sys/types.h

   * stdio.h

   * string.h

   * unistd.h - or, for getopt_long:

   * getopt.h

7.16 Internationalizing AutoOpts
================================

The generated code for AutoOpts will enable and disable the translation
of AutoOpts run time messages.  If `ENABLE_NLS' is defined at compile
time and `no-xlate' has been not set to the value _anything_, then the
`_()' macro may be used to specify a translation function.  If
undefined, it will default to `gettext(3GNU)'.  This define will also
enable a callback function that `optionProcess' invokes at the
beginning of option processing.  The AutoOpts `libopts' library will
always check for this _compiled with NLS_ flag, so `libopts' does not
need to be specially compiled.  The strings returned by the translation
function will be `strdup(3)-ed' and kept.  They will not be
re-translated, even if the locale changes, but they will also not be
dependent upon reused or unmappable memory.

   You should also ensure that the `ATTRIBUTE_FORMAT_ARG()' gets
`#define'-ed to something useful.  There is an autoconf macro named
`AG_COMPILE_FORMAT_ARG' in `ag_macros.m4' that will set it
appropriately for you.  If you do not do this, then translated
formatting strings may trigger GCC compiler warnings.

   To internationalize option processing, you should first
internationalize your program.  Then, the option processing strings can
be added to your translation text by processing the AutoOpts-generated
`my-opts.c' file and adding the distributed `po/usage-txt.pot' file.
(Also by extracting the strings yourself from the `usage-txt.h' file.)
When you call `optionProcess', all of the user visible AutoOpts strings
will be passed through the localization procedure established with the
`_()' preprocessing macro.

   All of this is _dis_-abled if you specify the global attribute
`no-xlate' to _anything_.

7.17 Naming Conflicts
=====================

AutoOpts generates a header file that contains many C preprocessing
macros and several external names.  For the most part, they begin with
either `opt_' or `option', or else they end with `_opt'.  If this
happens to conflict with other macros you are using, or if you are
compiling multiple option sets in the same compilation unit, the
conflicts can be avoided.  You may specify an external name `prefix'
(*note program attributes::) for all of the names generated for each
set of option definitions.

   Among these macros, several take an option name as a macro argument.
Sometimes, this will inconveniently conflict.  For example, if you
specify an option named, `debug', the emitted code will presume that
`DEBUG' is not a preprocessing name.  Or also, if you are building on a
Windows platform, you may find that MicroSoft has usurped a number of
user space names in its header files.  Consequently, you will get a
preprocessing error if you use, for example, `HAVE_OPT(DEBUG)' or
`HAVE_OPT(INTERNAL)' (*note HAVE_OPT::) in your code.  You may trigger
an obvious warning for such conflicts by specifying the
`guard-option-names' attribute (*note program attributes::).  That
emitted code will also `#undef'-ine the conflicting name.

7.18 All Attribute Names
========================

This is the list of all the option attributes used in the various
option processing templates.  There are several flavors of attributes,
and these are not distinguished here.

   * Valid, current attributes that you are encouraged to use.

   * Internally generated attributes that you cannot use at all.  I
     need to prefix these with a distinguished prefix.  e.g.  `ao-'

   * Valid attributes, but are deprecated.  Alternates should be
     documented.

   This list is derived by running many example option definitions
through the option generation and man page templates and noting which
attributes are actually used.  There may be a few that are used but not
exercised in my testing.  If so, I need to ferret those out and test
them, too.

8 Add-on packages for AutoGen
*****************************

This chapter includes several programs that either work closely with
AutoGen (extracting definitions or providing special formatting
functions), or leverage off of AutoGen technology.  There is also a
formatting library that helps make AutoGen possible.

   AutoOpts ought to appear in this list as well, but since it is the
primary reason why many people would even look into AutoGen at all, I
decided to leave it in the list of chapters.

8.1 Automated Finite State Machine
==================================

The templates to generate a finite state machine in C or C++ is included
with AutoGen.  The documentation is not.  The documentation is in HTML
format for viewing (http://www.gnu.org/software/autogen/autofsm.html),
or you can download FSM (http://download.sourceforge.net/autogen/).

8.2 Combined RPC Marshalling
============================

The templates and NFSv4 definitions are not included with AutoGen in
any way.  The folks that designed NFSv4 noticed that much time and
bandwidth was wasted sending queries and responses when many of them
could be bundled.  The protocol bundles the data, but there is no
support for it in rpcgen.  That means you have to write your own code
to do that.  Until now.  Download this and you will have a large,
complex example of how to use `AutoXDR' for generating the marshaling
and unmarshaling of combined RPC calls.  There is a brief example on
the web (http://www.gnu.org/software/autogen/xdr/index.html), but you
should download AutoXDR (http://download.sourceforge.net/autogen/).

8.3 Automated Event Management
==============================

Large software development projects invariably have a need to manage
the distribution and display of state information and state changes.
In other words, they need to manage their software events.  Generally,
each such project invents its own way of accomplishing this and then
struggles to get all of its components to play the same way.  It is a
difficult process and not always completely successful.  This project
helps with that.

   AutoEvents completely separates the tasks of supplying the data
needed for a particular event from the methods used to manage the
distribution and display of that event.  Consequently, the programmer
writing the code no longer has to worry about that part of the problem.
Likewise the persons responsible for designing the event management and
distribution no longer have to worry about getting programmers to write
conforming code.

   This is a work in progress.  See my web page
(http://www.gnu.org/software/autogen/autoevents.html) on the subject,
if you are interested.  I have some useful things put together, but it
is not ready to call a product.

8.4 Bit Maps and Enumerations
=============================

AutoGen provides two templates for managing enumerations and bit maps
(flag words).  They produce an enumeration of the enum or `#define's
for the bit maps, plus conversion functions for converting a string into
one of these values or converting one of these values into a human
readable string.  Finally, for enumerations, you may specify one or
more sets of dispatching functions that will be selected by identifying
a keyword prefix of a string (*note the dispatch attribute in Strings
to Enums and Back: enum-code.).

   There is a separate project that produces a GDB add-on that will add
these capabilities into GDB for bit masks.  (GDB does just fine with
enumerations.)

8.4.1 Enumerations
------------------

`str2enum.tpl'

   Produce an enumeration for a list of input "cmd"s (names).
Optionally, produce functions to:

   * convert a string to an enumeration

   * convert an enumeration value into a string

   * invoke a function based on the first token name found in a string

   The header file produced will contain the enumeration and
declarations for the optional procedures.  The code (`.c') file will
contain these optional procedures, but can be omitted if the `no-code'
attribute is specified.

   The following attributes are recognized with the `str2enum' template:

`cmd'
     You must provide a series of these attributes: they specify the
     list of names used in the enumeration.  Specific values for the
     names may be specified by specifying a numeric index for these
     attributes.  e.g. `cmd[5] = mumble;' will cause
         FOO_CMD_MUMBLE = 5
     to be inserted into the enumeration.  Do not specify a value of
     "invalid", unless you specify the `invalid-name' attribute.  (In
     that case, do not specify a `cmd' value that matches the
     `invalid-name' value.)

`prefix'
     This specifies the first segment of each enumeration name.  If not
     specified, the first segment of the enumeration definition file
     name will be used.  e.g. `foo-bar.def' will default to a `FOO'
     prefix.

`type'
     Normally, there is a second constant segment following the prefix.
     If not specified, it will be `CMD', so if both `prefix' and `type'
     were to default from `foo-bar.def', you will have enumeration
     values prefixed with `FOO_CMD_'.  If specified as the empty
     string, there will be no "type" component to the name and the
     default constant prefix will thus be `FOO_'.

`base-name'
     This specifies the base name of the output files, enumeration type
     and the translation functions.  The default is to use the
     `basename(3)' of the definition file.  e.g. `foo-bar.def' results
     in a `base-name' of `foo-bar'.

`invalid-val'
     The default invalid value is zero.  Sometimes, it is useful for
     zero to be valid.  If so, you can specify ~0 or the empty string
     to be invalid.  The empty string will cause the enumeration count
     (maximum value plus 1) to be the invalid value.

`invalid-name'
     By default, the invalid value is emitted into the enumeration as
     `FOO_INVALID_CMD'.  Specifying this attribute will replace
     `INVALID' with whatever you place in this attribute.

`add-on-text'
     Additional text to insert into the code or header file.

    `ao-file'
          Which file to insert the text into.  There are four choices,
          only two of which are relevant for the `str2enum' template:
          "enum-header", "enum-code", "mask-header" or "mask-code".

    `ao-text'
          The text to insert.

8.4.2 Strings to Enums and Back
-------------------------------

A continuation of the attributes for the `str2enum.tpl' template.

`no-code'
     Do not emit any string to enumeration or enumeration to string
     code at all.  If this is specified, the remainder of the
     attributes have no effect.

`no-name'
     Do not emit the enumeration to name function.

`no-case'
     When looking up a string, the case of the input string is ignored.

`alias'
     A single punctuation character can be interpreted as a command.
     The first character of this attribute is the aliased character and
     the remainder the aliased-to command.  e.g. "#comment" makes '#'
     an alias for the `comment' command.  "#comment" must still be
     listed in the `cmd' attributes.

`length'
     Specify how lengths are to be handled.  Under the covers,
     `gperf(1)' is used to map a string to an enumeration value.  The
     code it produces requires the string length to be passed in.  You
     may pass in the length yourself, or the generated code may figure
     it out, or you may ask for that length to be returned back after
     being figured out.

     You have four choices with the `length' attribute:

        * Do not specify it.  You will need to provide the length.

        * Specify "provided".  You will need to provide the length.

        * Specify "returned".  You must pass a pointer to a size_t
          object.  If the name is found, the length will be put there.

        * Specify an empty string.  The generated code will compute the
          length and that computed length will not be returned.  The
          length parameter may be omitted.  If the input strings
          contain only enumeration names, then this would be sufficient.

        * Specifying anything else is undefined.

`partial'
     Normally, a name must fully match to be found successfully.  This
     attribute causes the generated code to look for partial matches if
     the full match `gperf' function fails.  Partial matches must be at
     least two characters long.

`undef-str'
     by default, the display string for an undefined value is "*
     UNDEFINED *".  Use this to change that.

`equate'
     A series of punctuation characters considered equivalent.
     Typically, "-_" but sometimes (Tandem) "-_^".  Do not use '#' in
     the list of characters.

`dispatch'
     A lookup procedure will call a dispatch function for the procedure
     named after the keyword identified at the start of a string.
     Other than as specially noted below, for every named "cmd", must
     have a handling function, plus another function to handle errors,
     with "invalid" (or the `invalid-name' value) as the `cmd' name.
     Multiple `dispatch' definitions will produce multiple dispatching
     functions, each with (potentially) unique argument lists and
     return types.

     You may also use `add-on-text' to "#define" one function to
     another, thus allowing one function to handle multiple keywords or
     commands.  The `d-nam' and `d-ret' attributes are required.  The
     `d-arg', `d-omit' and `d-only' attributes are optional:

    `d-nam'
          This must be a printf format string with one formatting
          element: `%s'.  The `%s' will be replaced by each `cmd' name.
          The `%s' will be stripped and the result will be combined
          with the base name to construct the dispatch procedure name.

    `d-ret'
          The return type of the dispatched function, even if "void".

    `d-arg'
          If there are additional arguments that are to be passed
          through to the dispatched function, specify this as though it
          were part of the procedure header.  (It will be glued into
          the dispatching function as is and sedded into what is needed
          for the dispatched function.)

    `d-omit'
          Instead of providing handling functions for all of the `cmd'
          names, the invalid function will be called for omitted
          command codes.

    `d-only'
          You need only provide functions for the names listed by
          `d-only', plus the "invalid" name.  All other command values
          will trigger calls to the invalid handling function.  Note
          that the invalid call can distinguish from a command that
          could not be found by examining the value of its first (`id')
          argument.

     The handler functions will have the command enumeration as its
     first first argument, a pointer to a constant string that will be
     the character after the parsed command (keyword) name, plus any
     `d-arg' arguments that follow that.

     As an example, a file `samp-chk.def' containing this:
         AutoGen Definitions str2enum;
         cmd = one, two; invalid-name = oops;
         dispatch = { d-nam = 'hdl_%s_cmd'; d-ret = void; };
     will produce a header containing:
         typedef enum {
             SAMP_OOPS_CMD = 0,
             SAMP_CMD_ONE      = 1,
             SAMP_CMD_TWO      = 2,
             SAMP_COUNT_CMD
         } samp_chk_enum_t;

         extern samp_chk_enum_t
         find_samp_chk_cmd(char const * str, size_t len);

         typedef void(samp_chk_handler_t)(
             samp_chk_enum_t id, char const * str);

         samp_chk_handler_t
                 hdl_oops_cmd, hdl_one_cmd,  hdl_two_cmd;

         extern void
         disp_samp_chk(char * str, size_t len);

         extern char const *
         samp_chk_name(samp_chk_enum_t id);

        * `find_samp_chk_cmd' will look up a `len' byte `str' and
          return the corresponding `samp_chk_enum_t' value.  That value
          is `SAMP_OOPS_CMD' if the string is not "one" or "two".

        * `samp_chk_handler_t' is the type of the callback procedures.
          Three must be provided for the dispatching function to call:
          `hdl_oops_cmd', `hdl_one_cmd' and `hdl_two_cmd'.
          `hdl_oops_cmd' will receive calls when the string does not
          match.

        * `disp_samp_chk' this function will call the handler function
          and return whatever the handler returns.  In this case, it is
          void.

        * `samp_chk_name' will return a string corresponding to the
          enumeration value argument.  If the value is not valid, "*
          UNDEFINED *" (or the value of `undef-str') is used.

8.4.3 Bit Maps and Masks
------------------------

`str2mask.tpl'

   This template leverages highly off of enumerations (*note enums::).
It will produce a header file with bit masks defined for each bit
specified with a `cmd' attribute.  63 is the highest legal bit number
because this template has not been extended to cope with multiple word
masks.  (Patches would be welcome.)

   There are a few constraints on the names allowed:

   * names are constrained to alphanumerics and the underscore

   * aliases are not allowed

   * dispatch procedures are not allowed

   `no-code' and `no-name' are honored.  `dispatch' is not.  The lookup
function will examine each token in an input string, determine which
bit is specified and add it into a result.  The names may be prefixed
with a hyphen (-) or tilde (~) to remove the bit(s) from the cumulative
result.  If the string begins with a plus (+), hyphen or tilde, a "base
value" parameter is used for the starting mask, otherwise the conversion
starts with zero.

   Beyond the enumeration attributes that are used (or ignored), the
`str2mask' template accepts a `mask' attribute.  It takes a few
"subattributes":

`m-name'
     a special name for a sub-collection of the mask bits

`m-bit'
     The name of each previously defined bit(s).  If the desired
     previously defined value is a mask, that `m-name' must be suffixed
     with "-mask".

`m-invert'
     When all done collecting the bits, x-or the value with the mask of
     all the bits in the collection.

A mask of all bits in the collection is always generated.

8.5 Invoking columns
====================

This program was designed for the purpose of generating compact,
columnized tables.  It will read a list of text items from standard in
or a specified input file and produce a columnized listing of all the
non-blank lines.  Leading white space on each line is preserved, but
trailing white space is stripped.  Methods of applying per-entry and
per-line embellishments are provided.  See the formatting and
separation arguments below.

   This program is used by AutoGen to help clean up and organize its
output.

   See `autogen/agen5/fsm.tpl' and the generated output `pseudo-fsm.h'.

   This function was not implemented as an expression function because
either it would have to be many expression functions, or a provision
would have to be added to provide options to expression functions.
Maybe not a bad idea, but it is not being implemented at the moment.

   A side benefit is that you can use it outside of `autogen' to
columnize input, a la the `ls' command.

   This section was generated by *AutoGen*, using the `agtexi-cmd'
template and the option descriptions for the `columns' program.  This
software is released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or
later.

8.5.1 columns help/usage (`--help')
-----------------------------------

This is the automatically generated usage text for columns.

   The text printed is the same whether selected with the `help' option
(`--help') or the `more-help' option (`--more-help').  `more-help' will
print the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
`more-help' is disabled on platforms without a working `fork(2)'
function.  The `PAGER' environment variable is used to select the
program, defaulting to `more'.  Both will exit with a status code of 0.

8.5.2 dimensions options
------------------------

Specify the output dimensions.

width option (-W).
..................

This is the "maximum line width" option.  This option takes a number
argument `num'.  This option specifies the full width of the output
line, including any start-of-line indentation.  The output will fill
each line as completely as possible, unless the column width has been
explicitly specified.  If the maximum width is less than the length of
the widest input, you will get a single column of output.

columns option (-c).
....................

This is the "desired number of columns" option.  This option takes a
number argument `count'.  Use this option to specify exactly how many
columns to produce.  If that many columns will not fit within
LINE_WIDTH, then the count will be reduced to the number that fit.

col-width option (-w).
......................

This is the "set width of each column" option.  This option takes a
number argument `num'.  Use this option to specify exactly how many
characters are to be allocated for each column.  If it is narrower than
the widest entry, it will be over-ridden with the required width.

tab-width option.
.................

This is the "tab width" option.  This option takes a number argument
`num'.  If an indentation string contains tabs, then this value is used
to compute the ending column of the prefix string.

8.5.3 treatment options
-----------------------

Specify how to lay out the text.

spread option.
..............

This is the "maximum spread added to column width" option.  This option
takes a number argument `num'.  Use this option to specify exactly how
many characters may be added to each column.  It allows you to prevent
columns from becoming too far apart.  Without this option, `columns'
will attempt to widen columns to fill the full width.

fill option.
............

This is the "fill lines with input" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
     spread, col_width, by_columns.

   Instead of columnizing the input text, fill the output lines with
the input lines.  Blank lines on input will cause a blank line in the
output, unless the output is sorted.  With sorted output, blank lines
are ignored.

indent option (-I).
...................

This is the "line prefix or indentation" option.  This option takes a
string argument `l-pfx'.  If a number, then this many spaces will be
inserted at the start of every line.  Otherwise, it is a line prefix
that will be inserted at the start of every line.

first-indent option.
....................

This is the "first line prefix" option.  This option takes a string
argument `l-pfx'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must appear in combination with the following options: indent.

   If a number, then this many spaces will be inserted at the start of
the first line.  Otherwise, it is a line prefix that will be inserted
at the start of that line.  If its length exceeds "indent", then it
will be emitted on a line by itself, suffixed by any line separation
string.  For example:

    $ columns --first='#define TABLE' -c 2 -I4 --line=' \' <<_EOF_
    one
    two
    three
    four
    _EOF_
    #define TABLE \
        one   two \
        three four

format option (-f).
...................

This is the "formatting string for each input" option.  This option
takes a string argument `fmt-str'.  If you need to reformat each input
text, the argument to this option is interpreted as an `sprintf(3)'
format that is used to produce each output entry.

separation option (-S).
.......................

This is the "separation string - follows all but last" option.  This
option takes a string argument `sep-str'.  Use this option if, for
example, you wish a comma to appear after each entry except the last.

line-separation option.
.......................

This is the "string at end of all lines but last" option.  This option
takes a string argument `sep-str'.  Use this option if, for example,
you wish a backslash to appear at the end of every line, except the
last.

ending option.
..............

This is the "string at end of last line" option.  This option takes a
string argument `end-str'.  This option puts the specified string at
the end of the output.

8.5.4 ordering options
----------------------

Specify the ordering of the entries.

by-columns option.
..................

This is the "print entries in column order" option.  Normally, the
entries are printed out in order by rows and then columns.  This option
will cause the entries to be ordered within columns.  The final column,
instead of the final row, may be shorter than the others.

sort option (-s).
.................

This is the "sort input text" option.  This option takes an optional
string argument `key-pat'.  Causes the input text to be sorted.  If an
argument is supplied, it is presumed to be a pattern and the sort is
based upon the matched text.  If the pattern starts with or consists of
an asterisk (`*'), then the sort is case insensitive.

8.5.5 input-text options
------------------------

Redirecting stdin to an alternate file.

input option (-i).
..................

This is the "input file (if not stdin)" option.  This option takes a
string argument `file'.  This program normally runs as a `filter',
reading from standard input, columnizing and writing to standard out.
This option redirects input to a file.

8.5.6 presetting/configuring columns
------------------------------------

Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be preset by
loading values from configuration ("rc" or "ini") files, and values
from environment variables named `COLUMNS' and `COLUMNS_<OPTION_NAME>'.
`<OPTION_NAME>' must be one of the options listed above in upper case
and segmented with underscores.  The `COLUMNS' variable will be
tokenized and parsed like the command line.  The remaining variables
are tested for existence and their values are treated like option
arguments.

`libopts' will search in 2 places for configuration files:
   * $PWD

   * $HOME
   The environment variables `PWD', and `HOME' are expanded and
replaced when `columns' runs.  For any of these that are plain files,
they are simply processed.  For any that are directories, then a file
named `.columnsrc' is searched for within that directory and processed.

   Configuration files may be in a wide variety of formats.  The basic
format is an option name followed by a value (argument) on the same
line.  Values may be separated from the option name with a colon, equal
sign or simply white space.  Values may be continued across multiple
lines by escaping the newline with a backslash.

   Multiple programs may also share the same initialization file.
Common options are collected at the top, followed by program specific
segments.  The segments are separated by lines like:
    [COLUMNS]
   or by
    <?program columns>
   Do not mix these styles within one configuration file.

   Compound values and carefully constructed string values may also be
specified using XML syntax:
    <option-name>
       <sub-opt>...&lt;...&gt;...</sub-opt>
    </option-name>
   yielding an `option-name.sub-opt' string value of
    "...<...>..."
   `AutoOpts' does not track suboptions.  You simply note that it is a
hierarchicly valued option.  `AutoOpts' does provide a means for
searching the associated name/value pair list (see: optionFindValue).

   The command line options relating to configuration and/or usage help
are:

version (-v)
............

Print the program version to standard out, optionally with licensing
information, then exit 0.  The optional argument specifies how much
licensing detail to provide.  The default is to print just the version.
The licensing infomation may be selected with an option argument.  Only
the first letter of the argument is examined:

`version'
     Only print the version.  This is the default.

`copyright'
     Name the copyright usage licensing terms.

`verbose'
     Print the full copyright usage licensing terms.

8.5.7 columns exit status
-------------------------

One of the following exit values will be returned:
`0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)'
     Successful program execution.

`1 (EXIT_FAILURE)'
     The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

`66 (EX_NOINPUT)'
     A specified configuration file could not be loaded.

`70 (EX_SOFTWARE)'
     libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report it to
     autogen-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  Thank you.

8.5.8 columns See Also
----------------------

This program is documented more fully in the Columns section of the
Add-On chapter in the `AutoGen' Info system documentation.

8.6 Invoking getdefs
====================

If no `input' argument is provided or is set to simply "-", and if
`stdin' is not a `tty', then the list of input files will be read from
`stdin'.  This program extracts AutoGen definitions from a list of
source files.  Definitions are delimited by `/*=<entry-type>
<entry-name>\n' and `=*/\n'.  From that, this program creates a
definition of the following form:

        #line nnn "source-file-name"
        entry_type = {
            name = entry_name;
            ...
        };

  1. The ellipsis `...' is filled in by text found between the two
     delimiters.  Each line of text is stripped of anything before the
     first asterisk, then leading asterisks, then any leading or
     trailing white space.

  2. If what is left starts with what looks like a name followed by a
     colon, then it is interpreted as a name followed by a value.

  3. If the first character of the value is either a single or double
     quote, then you are responsible for quoting the text as it gets
     inserted into the output definitions.  So, if you want whitespace
     at the beginnings of the lines of text, you must do something like
     this:

          * mumble:
          * "  this is some\n"
          * "  indented text."

  4. If the `<entry-name>' is followed by a comma, the word `ifdef' (or
     `ifndef') and a name `if_name', then the above entry will be under
     `ifdef' control.

         /*=group entry_name, ifdef FOO
          * attr: attribute value
         =*/

     Will produce the following:

         #ifdef FOO
         #line nnn "source-file-name"
         group = {
             name = entry_name;
             attr = 'attribute value';
         };
         #endif

  5. If you use of the `subblock' option, you can specify a nested
     value, *Note getdefs subblock::.  That is, this text:

          * arg:  int, this, what-it-is

     with the `--subblock=arg=type,name,doc' option would yield:

         arg = { type = int; name = this; doc = what-it-is; };

   This section was generated by *AutoGen*, using the `agtexi-cmd'
template and the option descriptions for the `getdefs' program.  This
software is released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or
later.

8.6.1 getdefs help/usage (`help')
---------------------------------

This is the automatically generated usage text for getdefs.

   The text printed is the same whether selected with the `help' option
(`help') or the `more-help' option (`more-help').  `more-help' will
print the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
`more-help' is disabled on platforms without a working `fork(2)'
function.  The `PAGER' environment variable is used to select the
program, defaulting to `more'.  Both will exit with a status code of 0.

8.6.2 def-selection options
---------------------------

Specify which definitions are of interest and what to say about them.

defs-to-get option.
...................

This is the "regexp to look for after the "/*="" option.  This option
takes a string argument `reg-ex'.  If you want definitions only from a
particular category, or even with names matching particular patterns,
then specify this regular expression for the text that must follow the
`/*='.

subblock option.
................

This is the "subblock definition names" option.  This option takes a
string argument `sub-def'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   This option is used to create shorthand entries for nested
definitions.  For example, with:
using subblock thus
     `--subblock=arg=argname,type,null'

and defining an `arg' thus
     `arg: this, char *'

will then expand to:
     `arg = { argname = this; type = "char *"; };'
   The "this, char *" string is separated at the commas, with the white
space removed.  You may use characters other than commas by starting
the value string with a punctuation character other than a single or
double quote character.  You may also omit intermediate values by
placing the commas next to each other with no intervening white space.
For example, "+mumble++yes+" will expand to:
`arg = { argname = mumble; null = "yes"; };'.

listattr option.
................

This is the "attribute with list of values" option.  This option takes
a string argument `def'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   This option is used to create shorthand entries for definitions that
generally appear several times.  That is, they tend to be a list of
values.  For example, with:
`listattr=foo' defined, the text:
`foo: this, is, a, multi-list' will then expand to:
`foo = 'this', 'is', 'a', 'multi-list';'
The texts are separated by the commas, with the white space removed.
You may use characters other than commas by starting the value string
with a punctuation character other than a single or double quote
character.

8.6.3 enumerating options
-------------------------

specify how to number the definitions.

ordering option.
................

This is the "alphabetize or use named file" option.  This option takes
an optional string argument `file-name'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-ordering.

   * It is enabled by default.

   By default, ordering is alphabetical by the entry name.  Use,
`no-ordering' if order is unimportant.  Use `ordering' with no argument
to order without case sensitivity.  Use `ordering=<file-name>' if
chronological order is important.  getdefs will maintain the text
content of `file-name'.  `file-name' need not exist.

first-index option.
...................

This is the "the first index to apply to groups" option.  This option
takes a number argument `first-index'.  By default, the first
occurrence of a named definition will have an index of zero.
Sometimes, that needs to be a reserved value.  Provide this option to
specify a different starting point.

8.6.4 doc-insert options
------------------------

Definition insertion options.

filelist option.
................

This is the "insert source file names into defs" option.  This option
takes an optional string argument `file'.  Inserts the name of each
input file into the output definitions.  If no argument is supplied,
the format will be:
    infile = '%s';
   If an argument is supplied, that string will be used for the entry
name instead of INFILE.

assign option.
..............

This is the "global assignments" option.  This option takes a string
argument `ag-def'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   The argument to each copy of this option will be inserted into the
output definitions, with only a semicolon attached.

common-assign option.
.....................

This is the "assignments common to all blocks" option.  This option
takes a string argument `ag-def'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   The argument to each copy of this option will be inserted into each
output definition, with only a semicolon attached.

copy option.
............

This is the "file(s) to copy into definitions" option.  This option
takes a string argument `file'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   The content of each file named by these options will be inserted into
the output definitions.

srcfile option.
...............

This is the "insert source file name into each def" option.  This
option takes an optional string argument `file'.  Inserts the name of
the input file where a definition was found into the output definition.
If no argument is supplied, the format will be:
    srcfile = '%s';
   If an argument is supplied, that string will be used for the entry
name instead of SRCFILE.

linenum option.
...............

This is the "insert source line number into each def" option.  This
option takes an optional string argument `def-name'.  Inserts the line
number in the input file where a definition was found into the output
definition.  If no argument is supplied, the format will be:
    linenum = '%s';
   If an argument is supplied, that string will be used for the entry
name instead of LINENUM.

8.6.5 input-files options
-------------------------

specify which files to search for markers.

input option.
.............

This is the "input file to search for defs" option.  This option takes
a string argument `src-file'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   All files that are to be searched for definitions must be named on
the command line or read from `stdin'.  If there is only one `input'
option and it is the string, "-", then the input file list is read from
`stdin'.  If a command line argument is not an option name and does not
contain an assignment operator (`='), then it defaults to being an
input file name.  At least one input file must be specified.

8.6.6 doc-output options
------------------------

Definition output disposition options:.

output option.
..............

This is the "output file to open" option.  This option takes a string
argument `file'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * is a member of the autogen class of options.

   If you are not sending the output to an AutoGen process, you may
name an output file instead.

autogen option.
...............

This is the "invoke autogen with defs" option.  This option takes an
optional string argument `ag-cmd'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-autogen.

   * It is enabled by default.

   * is a member of the autogen class of options.

   This is the default output mode.  Specifying `no-autogen' is
equivalent to `output=-'.  If you supply an argument to this option,
that program will be started as if it were AutoGen and its standard in
will be set to the output definitions of this program.

template option.
................

This is the "template name" option.  This option takes a string
argument `file'.  Specifies the template name to be used for generating
the final output.

agarg option.
.............

This is the "autogen argument" option.  This option takes a string
argument `ag-opt'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

   * must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
     output.

   This is a pass-through argument.  It allows you to specify any
arbitrary argument to be passed to AutoGen.

base-name option.
.................

This is the "base name for output file(s)" option.  This option takes a
string argument `name'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
     output.

   When output is going to AutoGen, a base name must either be supplied
or derived.  If this option is not supplied, then it is taken from the
`template' option.  If that is not provided either, then it is set to
the base name of the current directory.

8.6.7 presetting/configuring getdefs
------------------------------------

Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be preset by
loading values from configuration ("rc" or "ini") files.

`libopts' will search in `/dev/null' for configuration (option) data.
If this is a plain file, it is simply processed.  If it is a directory,
then a file named `.getdefsrc' is searched for within that directory.

   Configuration files may be in a wide variety of formats.  The basic
format is an option name followed by a value (argument) on the same
line.  Values may be separated from the option name with a colon, equal
sign or simply white space.  Values may be continued across multiple
lines by escaping the newline with a backslash.

   Multiple programs may also share the same initialization file.
Common options are collected at the top, followed by program specific
segments.  The segments are separated by lines like:
    [GETDEFS]
   or by
    <?program getdefs>
   Do not mix these styles within one configuration file.

   Compound values and carefully constructed string values may also be
specified using XML syntax:
    <option-name>
       <sub-opt>...&lt;...&gt;...</sub-opt>
    </option-name>
   yielding an `option-name.sub-opt' string value of
    "...<...>..."
   `AutoOpts' does not track suboptions.  You simply note that it is a
hierarchicly valued option.  `AutoOpts' does provide a means for
searching the associated name/value pair list (see: optionFindValue).

   The command line options relating to configuration and/or usage help
are:

version
.......

Print the program version to standard out, optionally with licensing
information, then exit 0.  The optional argument specifies how much
licensing detail to provide.  The default is to print just the version.
The licensing infomation may be selected with an option argument.  Only
the first letter of the argument is examined:

`version'
     Only print the version.  This is the default.

`copyright'
     Name the copyright usage licensing terms.

`verbose'
     Print the full copyright usage licensing terms.

8.6.8 getdefs exit status
-------------------------

One of the following exit values will be returned:
`0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)'
     Successful program execution.

`1 (EXIT_FAILURE)'
     The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

`66 (EX_NOINPUT)'
     A specified configuration file could not be loaded.

`70 (EX_SOFTWARE)'
     libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report it to
     autogen-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  Thank you.

8.6.9 getdefs See Also
----------------------

This program is documented more fully in the Getdefs section of the
Add-On chapter in the `AutoGen' Info system documentation.

8.7 Invoking xml2ag
===================

This program will convert any arbitrary XML file into equivalent
AutoGen definitions, and invoke AutoGen.  The template used will be
derived from either:
   * The *-override-tpl* command line option

   * A top level XML attribute named, "`template'"
   One or the other *must* be provided, or the program will exit with a
failure message.

   The _base-name_ for the output will similarly be either:
   * The *-base-name* command line option.

   * The base name of the `.xml' file.

   The definitions derived from XML generally have an extra layer of
definition.  Specifically, this XML input:
    <mumble attr="foo">
      mumble-1
      <grumble>
      grumble, grumble, grumble.
    </grumble>mumble, mumble
    </mumble>
   Will get converted into this:
    mumble = {
      grumble = {
        text = 'grumble, grumble, grumble';
      };
      text = 'mumble-1';
      text = 'mumble, mumble';
    };
   Please notice that some information is lost.  AutoGen cannot tell
that "grumble" used to lie between the mumble texts.  Also please note
that you cannot assign:
    grumble = 'grumble, grumble, grumble.';
   because if another "grumble" has an attribute or multiple texts, it
becomes impossible to have the definitions be the same type (compound
or text values).

   This section was generated by *AutoGen*, using the `agtexi-cmd'
template and the option descriptions for the `xml2ag' program.  This
software is released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or
later.

8.7.1 xml2ag help/usage (`--help')
----------------------------------

This is the automatically generated usage text for xml2ag.

   The text printed is the same whether selected with the `help' option
(`--help') or the `more-help' option (`--more-help').  `more-help' will
print the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
`more-help' is disabled on platforms without a working `fork(2)'
function.  The `PAGER' environment variable is used to select the
program, defaulting to `more'.  Both will exit with a status code of 0.

     The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

8.8 Replacement for Stdio Formatting Library
============================================

Using the `printf' formatting routines in a portable fashion has always
been a pain, and this package has been way more pain than anyone ever
imagined.  Hopefully, with this release of snprintfv, the pain is now
over for all time.

   The issues with portable usage are these:

  1. Argument number specifiers are often either not implemented or are
     buggy.  Even GNU libc, version 1 got it wrong.

  2. ANSI/ISO "forgot" to provide a mechanism for computing argument
     lists for vararg procedures.

  3. The argument array version of printf (`printfv()') is not
     generally available, does not work with the native printf, and
     does not have a working argument number specifier in the format
     specification.  (Last I knew, anyway.)

  4. You cannot fake varargs by calling `vprintf()' with an array of
     arguments, because ANSI does not require such an implementation
     and some vendors play funny tricks because they are allowed to.

   These four issues made it impossible for AutoGen to ship without its
own implementation of the `printf' formatting routines.  Since we were
forced to do this, we decided to make the formatting routines both
better and more complete :-).  We addressed these issues and added the
following features to the common printf API:

  5. The formatted output can be written to

        * a string allocated by the formatting function (`asprintf()').

        * a file descriptor instead of a file stream (`dprintf()').

        * a user specified stream (`stream_printf()').

  6. The formatting functions can be augmented with your own functions.
     These functions are allowed to consume more than one character
     from the format, but must commence with a unique character.  For
     example,

         "%{struct stat}\n"

     might be used with '{' registered to a procedure that would look
     up "struct stat" in a symbol table and do appropriate things,
     consuming the format string through the '}' character.

   Gary V. Vaughan was generous enough to supply this implementation.
Many thanks!!

   For further details, the reader is referred to the snprintfv
documentation.  These functions are also available in the template
processing as  `sprintf' (*note SCM sprintf::), `printf' (*note SCM
printf::), `fprintf' (*note SCM fprintf::), and `shellf' (*note SCM
shellf::).

9 Some ideas for the future.
****************************

Here are some things that might happen in the distant future.

   * Fix up current tools that contain miserably complex perl, shell,
     sed, awk and m4 scripts to instead use this tool.
