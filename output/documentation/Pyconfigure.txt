pyconfigure
***********

This manual is for pyconfigure (version 0.2.1, 21 August 2013).

1 Introduction
**************

Python packages typically are configured and installed through the use
of the `distutils' module or one of its derivatives. The user performs
necessary actions via a Python script called `setup.py'. For simple
programs, this is straight-forward. However, for more complex software
packages, especially for those which also include code in other
languages such as C or Fortran, the limitations of the `distutils'
method quickly become apparent.

   The configuration and installation of GNU software and many other
programs, on the other hand, is done according to the use of standard
`configure' scripts and Make recipes. This method has the advantage of
being language-agnostic, very flexible, and time-proven. pyconfigure
consists of all the files necessary to begin using the standard GNU
build process to configure and install a Python package.

1.1 Configuring Python packages
===============================

Configuring and installing Python packages which use pyconfigure
follows the familiar steps of all standard GNU software:

     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make install

   As usual, the user may pass arguments to `configure' in order to
specify how she wants the software to be installed. By default, the
generated `configure' script takes the following useful arguments,
among others:

Argument           Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
`--prefix'         Set the root directory in which to install files
                   (default=/usr/local)
`--with-virtualenv'Install to a virtualenv at `$prefix'
`PYTHON'           Path to the Python interpreter to use
`PYTHONPATH'       The PYTHONPATH to use during the installation

   However, as the developer is expected to customize these files, the
final `configure' script may take many more arguments. The developer is
expected to provide proper documentation in this case.

2 Installation
**************

Pyconfigure includes the template files that you will use in your
projects, the `pyconf' script to copy those files into a project's
directory, and this documentation. In order for their usage to be
convenient, it is recommended to install them. Installation of
pyconfigure follows the standard GNU installation procedure. Upon
unpacking the source, navigate into its directory and run the following
command sequence:

     $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
     $ make install

   If you wish the files to be installed to a different location,
specify it using the `--prefix' option.

3 Invoking pyconf
*****************

Before invoking the `pyconf' script, you first must decide whether you
would prefer to have your installation logic written in Python or in
Make. If you choose the former, the generated Makefile will be a
wrapper around the Python installation script (i.e. `setup.py'), while
if you choose the latter, the Python installation script will be a
wrapper around the Makefile.

   Next, you must create a `PKG-INFO' file containing standard metadata
about your project (*note PKG-INFO metadata::). Finally, in the most
basic case, you would navigate to your project's directory and simply
invoke `pyconf' on your project's `PKG-INFO' file:

     $ pyconf PKG-INFO

   This will generate a `configure.ac' Autoconf file, a `configure'
script generated from that Autoconf file, a `setup.py.in' installation
file (to be configured by the user upon the invocation of `configure')
and a `Makefile.in' file which wraps the functionality of `setup.py'.
If any of these files already exist, `pyconf' will not overwrite them
unless the `--overwrite' option is passed.

   If you wish the files to be copied into a different directory, you
may add the `--output' option (or its short form `-o') to specify the
directory into which you would prefer the files to be copied.

     $ pyconf -output=$HOME/Projects/pyproject PKG-INFO

   If you would prefer to write your installation logic using Make, pass
the `--prefer-make' (`-m') option:

     $ pyconf --prefer-make PKG-INFO

   Now, the `setup.py.in' script that is generated will instead be a
wrapper around the `Makefile.in' file. You would then extend the
installation process in the latter file.

   If you would prefer a pure-Python approach, pyconf may optionally not
generate any Makefile by passing the `--no-make' option. Finally, if
you only need pyconfigure's Autoconf macros, you may pass the
`--macros-only' option, which causes `pyconf' to exit immediately after
copying the macros into your package directory.

3.1 PKG-INFO metadata
=====================

As a base, the `pyconf' script requires a `PKG-INFO' file containing
metadata about the project. This file should fit the requirements of
the `PKG-INFO' metadata file format as outlined in the PEP 345 document
(http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0345/). The file consists of
several `Key: value' pairs. Some keys may be specified more than once,
meaning that the package has several such values, while others may
appear only once. Refer to PEP 345 for the authoritative specification.

   For the purposes of pyconfigure, only four keys are required. The
first, "Metadata-Version" must have a value of 1.2 or higher; earlier
metadata specification versions are not supported. "Name", which may
only appear once, contains the package's name. Similarly, "Version"
contains the package version number. Finally, "Author-email" contains
the principal email address for the project. Other keys are required to
fully meet the PEP 345 specification; refer to that document for more
information.

   Here is a minimal example required to get started:

     Metadata-Version: 1.2
     Name: foo
     Version: 1.5
     Author-email: bug-foo@gnu.org

4 Existing projects
*******************

Using pyconfigure with existing projects is easy. For example, if your
project already has a `setup.py' script, there is no need to replace it
with pyconfigure. In this case, the best way to proceed would be to run
`pyconf' to copy all of the files into your project's directory. Next,
you simply need to copy the contents of your `setup.py' script into
`setup.py.in'. Be sure not to just overwrite the file directly! Inside
`setup.py.in' you will see several strings like `@PACKAGE_NAME@'. These
are strings that will be replaced by the configure script and they
should remain as they are. Most of the contents of the standard `setup'
function should have already been filled in through the information in
the `PKG-INFO' file but if not, they can be filled in manually. The
default `setup.py.in' script is otherwise very simple, meaning any
extensions to it that you have written in your `setup.py' script can
simply be copied in.

   If your project does not yet have a `setup.py' script but it already
has a `Makefile', the process is even easier. Simply call `pyconf' with
`--prefer-make' and the `setup.py.in' file that is generated in your
project's directory will simply wrap your `Makefile' (just be sure not
to pass the `--overwrite' option!).

5 Customization
***************

Once `pyconf' has generated the files in your project's directory, you
should customize them to meet your project's needs.

   In particular, you will want to customize `configure.ac' and
`Makefile.in' or `setup.py.in'. `configure.ac' contains a series of
macros which are used by Autoconf to build a portable `configure' shell
script. This script either guesses important system settings or is
provided them by the user. When the user invokes `configure', it uses
`Makefile.in' and `setup.py.in' as templates to create the Make recipe
`Makefile' and the Python setup script `setup.py'.

5.1 configure.ac
================

There are some minimum modifications that should be made in
`configure.ac'. The file contains a significant amount of information
in the form of comments, so it is possible to discern your needs while
editing. For more advanced usage, it is recommended to refer to the
*note Autoconf manual: (autoconf)Autoconf.

   In this file you will see a macro called `AC_INIT'. This is a
standard Autoconf macro. The arguments to this are automatically
generated from the `PKG-INFO' file that you used. These three values
are used extensively in the files modified by the configure script, so
it is important that they be correct.

   Further down, you will also find a macro called `PC_INIT'. This is
the core macro of pyconfigure. This will build the code necessary to
find a suitable Python interpreter on the user's computer. To that end,
you can pass arguments to this macro which specify the minimum and/or
maximum supported Python versions.

   While the default `configure.ac' script will likely be sufficient
for a basic Python-based project, it may be made to be much more
powerful for packages with more complex needs. To that end, several
Autoconf macros are provided in the file `m4/python.m4' to allow the
developer to write robust tests *Note Autoconf macros::. Note that when
you distribute your software, you must include this directory and file
with your distribution if you also distribute your `configure.ac' file.

   Once you modify your `configure.ac' to your liking, you must
regenerate your `configure' script with the `bootstrap.sh' script that
is generated by pyconfigure.

     $ ./bootstrap.sh

   A full explanation of the general use of Autoconf macros is beyond
the scope of this document, however it is worth presenting some
examples.

5.1.1 Required macros
---------------------

Several macros are required in `configure.ac' to use pyconfigure. These
are:

     AC_INIT([project_name], [project_version], [project-email])

   This initializes Autoconf and also substitutes your project name and
version in any output that it generates. The initial argument values
are automatically generated by pyconfigure when you first run the
`pyconf' script. Note that the arguments are surrounded by braces in
all cases. This is to prevent M4 from trying to expand the arguments
using whatever macros it knows.

     AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4])

   This macro imports all of the Python Autoconf macros. If you choose
to write your own macros for other purposes, you should include them in
the `m4' directory as well.

     PC_INIT([2.5], [3.3.1])

   This is the key macro. It finds a Python interpreter available on the
system that meets optional version requirements specified in its
arguments and saves its path in the `PYTHON' variable. Generally
speaking, the highest-version Python interpreter found within the given
version range (inclusive) will be used. Note, however, that minor
version differences may cause discrepancies. For example, the user may
have Python 3.3.1 installed but a slight difference in its release may
cause the interpreter to internally report a slightly higher version,
causing this interpreter to not pass the version check. To be safe, set
the maximum version one bugfix release higher (i.e. "3.3.2" in this
case).

     PC_PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGE_DIR
     PC_PYTHON_EXEC_PACKAGE_DIR

   These two macros figure out where Python expects packages to be
installed (i.e. `/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/') and saves them in
the variables `pkgpythondir' and `pkgpyexecdir', respectively, for use
in `Makefile.in'. These macros are only required if you will be writing
your installation logic in Make.

5.1.2 Verifying the Python version
----------------------------------

As described in the previous section, `PC_INIT' finds the Python
interpreter with the highest version that meets the provided
requirements. You may wish to perform other tests on the version number
yourself. There is a macro available to simplify this,
`PC_PYTHON_VERIFY_VERSION' (indeed, `PC_INIT' uses this macro
internally).

     m4_define(python_min_ver, 2.6.1)
     PC_PYTHON_VERIFY_VERSION([>=], python_min_ver, ,
                              [AC_MSG_ERROR(Python interpreter too old)])

   In this example, we set the minimum version to 2.6.1 through the use
of an M4 macro. We then check if the interpreter stored in the `PYTHON'
variable (either set by the user or found by `PC_INIT') is at least of
that version. If it is not, the resulting `configure' script will exit
with an appropriate error message. You may use any mathematical
comparison operator that Python recognizes for the first argument
("==", "<=", ">", etc.).

5.1.3 Checking for a module or function
---------------------------------------

It's reasonable to assume that many Python packages will have
dependencies on other, external modules. With the provided pyconfigure
macros, it is simple to check for the presence of dependencies on the
system. All you have to do is use the `PC_PYTHON_CHECK_MODULE' macro as
follows:

     PC_PYTHON_CHECK_MODULE([foo])

   In this example, we checked for the presence of a module "foo."

   If the module is a hard requirement, you may provide actions to do if
it is not present:

     PC_PYTHON_CHECK_MODULE([foo], , AC_MSG_ERROR([Module foo is not installed]))

   If you need more fine-grained control, you can also test for a
specific function, for example `foo.bar(arg1, arg2)':

     PC_PYTHON_CHECK_FUNC([foo], [bar], [arg1, arg2])

   Remember that you may omit arguments to Autoconf macros: in the
previous example, the final two arguments, which correspond to the
action to take if the test is successful and if it fails simply are not
present in the argument list. Similarly, if you do not need to pass
arguments to the test function, you can entirely omit the third
argument to the macro:

     PC_PYTHON_CHECK_FUNC([foo], [bar])

5.1.4 Writing test programs
---------------------------

One great benefit of Autoconf is the ability to embed test programs
inside `configure'. The pyconfigure macros allow for this by defining
Python as a language within Autoconf. You then would proceed to write
test programs as you would in any other language that Autoconf supports
like C.

     AC_LANG_PUSH(Python)[]
     AC_RUN_IFELSE([AC_LANG_PROGRAM([dnl
     # some code here
     import foo
     ], [dnl
         # some more code here
         foo.bar()
     ])], [ACTION-IF-SUCCESSFUL], [ACTION-IF-FAILED])
     AC_LANG_POP(Python)[]

   The first argument to `AC_LANG_PROGRAM' is the so-called "prolog",
and typically will contain your `import' statements or function
definitions. The second argument contains the main body of the program,
which will be in the scope of an `if __name__=="__main__":' block. So,
you must be sure to indent the code appropriately.

5.1.5 Using Sphinxbuild to build documentation
----------------------------------------------

Using pyconfigure and Autoconf to test for other tools is quite easy.
For example, many Python packages use Sphinxbuild to build their
documentation. If this is the case for your project, you might do
something like the following:

     AC_CHECK_PROGS([SPHINXBUILD], [sphinx-build sphinx-build3 sphinx-build2], [no])
     AS_IF([test "x$SPHINXBUILD" = xno],
     	    AC_MSG_WARN(sphinx-build is required to build documentation))

   We simply use Autoconf's `AC_CHECK_PROGS' macro to check for a
series of possible Sphinxbuild binaries and save the result to the
SPHINXBUILD variable, which may then be used in `Makefile.in':

     docs/build/index.html: $(wildcard $(srcdir)/docs/source/*)
     ifneq ($(SPHINXBUILD),no)
      	$(SPHINXBUILD) -b html docs/source/ docs/build/
     endif

5.2 Makefile.in
===============

How you will customize the file `Makefile.in' and, indeed, what you
will find in the file when it is first generated both depend on whether
you specified if you prefer to write your installation logic in Make
*Note Invoking pyconf::.

5.2.1 Makefile.in (distutils)
-----------------------------

If you did not specify `--prefer-make', `Makefile.in' will be a wrapper
around the functionality of the Python `setup.py' script. For a basic
program, no great amount of customization of this file will be
necessary. The file contains many comments, which introduce its various
sections.

   By default, the file supports installing to a Virtualenv, depending
on whether the user has specified to do so when running `configure'.
You will likely not have to change the "install" recipe. If you have
other files to install, it is recommended to create new targets to
install them, and to add those targets as prerequisites to the
"install" target. For example, if you have extra data files to install,
you might create a "install-data" target and corresponding recipe, and
then add "install-data" as a prerequisite to "install":

     install: installdirs install-data

   If you do install more files, be sure that they are properly removed
when the user runs `make uninstall' by modifying the recipe for the
"uninstall" target. Note that, at this time, Python's `distutils' does
not have its own "uninstall" target, so this must be done manually.

   If you intend to produce source distributions via the `Makefile',
which is more flexible than doing so via `setup.py', it is important to
modify the `DIST_FILES' variable located near the top of `Makefile.in'.
Any file or directory you list there will be included in your source
distribution.

   Finally, you may write recipes to build your package's documentation,
which may not be covered by your `setup.py' script. How you accomplish
this is highly dependent upon how you have organized your documentation
sources. One example of how you might do it is included in the
`Makefile.in', commented-out at the end.

5.2.2 Makefile.in (Make)
------------------------

If you passed the option `--prefer-make' to `pyconf', `Makefile.in'
will contain all of the installation logic for your package. It is
highly recommended that you be familiar with basic Make usage. See the
*note Make manual: (make)Make.

   By default, `Makefile.in' will contain the logic necessary to
install a basic Python package consisting of one or more modules. The
primary customization may be performed via the variables found at the
beginning of the file: `PYPACKAGES', `PYPACKAGE_ROOT', `SCRIPTS',
`PKG_DATA', `DATA', and `DATA_ROOT'.

   `PYPACKAGES' should contain a space-separated list of all of the
Python modules in your package (i.e. top-level directories containing a
`__init__.py' file). When your package is installed to the user's
computer, these modules will be stored in the Python package directory
(generally `$prefix/lib/python$version/{site,dist}-packages/'). If the
modules are contained in a sub-directory, say `src', of your source
directory, you may set the `PYPACKAGE_ROOT' variable to that directory.

     PYPACKAGES = foo bar
     PYPACKAGE_ROOT = src

   In this example, there are two modules to install: "foo" and "bar".
The modules are to be found under the `src' directory; thus, for
example, module "foo" is to be found at `src/foo'.

   The directories listed under `PYPACKAGES' will only have their
Python files installed. If your modules depend on other, non-Python
data files, you may list these under the `PKG_DATA' variable. Data
files should be listed relative to their parent module. Thus, if module
"foo" contains a file called `bar.dat', set `PKG_DATA = foo/bar.dat'.

   Other data files, which are not specific to any of the Python
modules, may be specified under the `DATA' variable. As before, if your
data files are all stored under a particular sub-directory, you may
specify it in `DATA_ROOT'. Files listed under `DATA' are installed to
the package's data directory, which is typically
`/usr/local/share/$package').

   Finally, if your package has any scripts to install, list them under
the `SCRIPTS' variable. They should be listed as files relative to the
directory containing `Makefile.in'. Thus, if your script `baz' is
located in the sub-directory `bin', you would set `SCRIPTS = bin/baz'.

   One particular advantage of writing the installation logic in Make is
the ease with which you may work with non-Python code in your project,
such as extensions written in C. How these recipes are to be written is
dependent upon the build requirements of this code, and you are thus
referred to the *note Make manual: (make)Make. Any installation recipes
should be given their own targets and made as prerequisites of the
"install" target.

5.3 setup.py.in
===============

`pyconf' will automatically generate a `setup.py.in' file, to be
configured by the `configure' script to produce the Python `setup.py'
script. If the `--prefer-make' option was specified, this file will
merely contain Python code which calls Make on the generated
`Makefile', and needs not to be modified. Otherwise, the file will
contain basic Python code to use `distutils' for package installation.
The reader is referred to the Python documentation for more information
on how to customize this file.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
