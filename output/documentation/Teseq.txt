1 Overview
**********

GNU Teseq (the author pronounces it: "tea" + "seek") is a tool for
analyzing files that contain control characters and terminal control
sequences, by printing these control sequences and their meanings in
readable English.  It is intended to be useful for debugging terminal
emulators, and programs that make heavy use of advanced terminal
features such as cursor movement, coloring, and other effects.

Teseq is useful for:
   * creating animated, interactive demos to run on the terminal (see
     <https://asciinema.org/a/7445> for a video on how to do this),
   * knowing the exact output of a program (Did it have spaces at the
     end of the line?  Or maybe it contains invisible control
     characters?),
   * examining a text file's contents unambiguously, a la 'cat -v' or
     the 'ed' program's 'l' command (but with much more information),
   * stripping control sequences from a text file, e.g.  to produce a
     plain ascii text file from a typescript file generated by the
     'script' command (see example below),
   * examining the invisible control sequences within a text file, that
     affect graphical formatting or character encoding, in order to
     understand how they work and where they appear in the file, or
   * debugging graphical terminal applications, and terminal emulators
     (its originally-intended purpose).

GNU Teseq is free software (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).
*Note Copying::, for copying conditions.

A Quick Example
===============

You can't beat a short example to demonstrate what a program does, so
here goes (note: a video version of this example may be seen at the main
Teseq project page (http://www.gnu.org/software/teseq/), or at
<https://asciinema.org/a/7443>.  Suppose you've got a program that
writes the following output to a terminal.

     *Hi* there, world

A simple text string, using a boldface font to render the first word.

Suppose that, after a moment or two, the program then replaced the final
word "world" with the word "earth".

In order to achieve this effect, the program would have to send special
controls to the terminal to ask it to start writing in bold text, and
then to revert back to normal text for the rest.  To replace the final
word, it might have to issue a series of backspaces before issuing the
replacement word.  All of this will be handled transparently by the
terminal, and you wouldn't see any of the special c aracters the program
sent to the terminal--unless perhaps you convinced the program to write
to a text file as if it were writing to a terminal, or ran the program
under a terminal capture utility such as the 'script' command.

You may be able to produce this effect yourself with the following shell
command.

     $ printf '\033[1mHi\033[m there, world'; sleep 1; \
         printf '\b\b\b\b\bearth\n'

If you were to examine the output from such a command with a text
editor, it might look something like this.

     ^[[1mHi^[[m there, world^H^H^H^H^Hearth

Not very readable, is it?  That's where Teseq comes in!  When you run
that gibberish through the 'teseq' command with the default settings,
you'll get the following output.

     : Esc [ 1 m
     & SGR: SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION
     " Set bold text.
     |Hi|
     : Esc [ 0 m
     & SGR: SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION
     " Clear graphic rendition to defaults.
     | there, world|
     . BS/^H BS/^H BS/^H BS/^H BS/^H
     |earth|.

Note that the special control sequences that tell the terminal to start
and stop writing in boldface text are separated out on their own lines
(prefixed with a colon ':'), and followed by an identification (prefixed
with an ampersand '&') and a description of what it does (prefixed with
a quote character '"').

The actual text appears in lines bracketed by pipe '|' characters.

The series of single-character backspace controls appear on a line
prefixed with a period '.', identified by its identifying acronym (BS
for BACKSPACE), and its control-key representation (Control-H).

The final word, "earth", is followed by a period just after the closing
pipe symbol; this indicates a following linefeed (or "newline")
character.

The 'reseq' command may be used to reverse the procedure, accepting the
above input and printing out the original set of escape sequences that
produced it.  *Note Reseq::.

Stripping out escapes
=====================

The 'teseq' command can be instructed to recognize, but not output,
escapes encountered in the input.  This is useful for stripping out the
formatting strings that are invisible on display, but which get in the
way during editing, or make the content inappropriate for inclusion in
documentation, etc.

To sanitize a typescript file or other text file containing control
sequences, try the following command:

     $ teseq -EDLC YOUR-FILE.TXT | reseq - - | col -b > NEW-FILE.TXT

The '-EDLC' options tell teseq not to output recognized escape sequences
or identify them, and otherwise to abbreviate its output.  Then, 'reseq'
takes the output from 'teseq' and turns it back into raw text (minus the
now elided escape sequences).  Finally, 'col -b' (a fairly standard Unix
tool) interprets common control characters such as backspaces and
carriage returns, resolving them into a text file that displays the
same, but doesn't contain those controls.

2 Invoking Teseq
****************

The format for running the 'teseq' program is:

     teseq OPTIONS [INPUT-FILE [OUTPUT-FILE]]
     teseq -h | --help
     teseq -V | --version

If INPUT-FILE or OUTPUT-FILE is unspecified, or specified as '-',
standard input/output is used.  Output is written to standard output by
default, but see the '-o' option.

'-h'
'--help'
     Print usage information on standard output and exit successfully.

'-V'
'--version'
     Print the version number and licensing information for 'teseq' on
     standard output and then exit successfully.

'-C'
     For control characters from the C0 set of Ecma-48 / ISO/IEC 6429,
     don't write the control-key representation, only the identifying
     acronym.  For example, write the carriage-return/line-feed
     combination as
          . CR LF
     rather than
          . CR/^M LF/^J

'-D'
     Don't print description lines (those beginning with '"').

'-E'
     Don't print escape-sequence lines (beginning with ':').  *Warning:*
     this results in loss of information, and in particular means that
     running the output through the 'reseq' command won't reproduce the
     input.

     Still, this option can be useful (in combination with '-L') for
     those that don't care about the exact sequence of characters, or
     what their function is called, but just what their effects in the
     terminal are (those that Teseq understands).  The output produced
     will describe what happened, but not how.

'-L'
     Don't print identifying labels (lines beginning with '&') for
     escape sequences.

'--color[=WHEN]'
'--colour[=WHEN]'
     Colorize the output.  WHEN defaults to 'always' or can be 'never'
     or 'auto'.

'-I'
'--no-interactive'
     Don't put the terminal into non-canonical or no-echo mode, and
     don't try to ensure output lines are finished when a signal is
     received (see below).

'-b'
'--buffered'
     Force 'teseq' to use buffered I/O (see below).

'-t TIMINGS'
'--timings TIMINGS'
     Read timing information from TIMINGS and emit delay lines.  This
     file must be formatted as if generated by 'script -t' (for the
     'script' command from util-linux).

'-x'
     No effect.  Accepted for backwards compatibility.

Note that there are no options for suppressing text lines ('|') or
control-character lines ('.'), as there are for description or
escape-sequence lines.

The '-L', '-D' and '-E' options also have mnemonic equivalents of '-&',
'-"' and '-:' respectively, corresponding to the character prefixes for
the lines they suppress; and '-C' has an '-^' equivalent, for the
'^X'-style control representations it suppresses.  However, while they
may be more practical to remember, they will be less practical to type,
since both '-&' and '-"' are apt to be interpreted as special by the
shell, and must be quoted with a backslash ('-\&' and '-\"') in order to
pass them to the 'teseq' command.

Interactive Mode
================

When 'teseq' is started with a terminal as its input, it sets the
terminal to non-canonical mode.  That way, you can see real-time
translation of input, as you type.  If both input and output are
terminals, then 'teseq' will also turn local echo off, so that the
characters you type will not interfere with the output you see.  You can
try it out by simply running 'teseq' without any arguments.  *Note*,
this means that the control for indicating "end-of-file" (usually 'C-d')
will not be processed specially, but will be passed through to 'teseq'
like any other character.  Use the interrupt character (usually 'C-c')
instead, or specify '--no-interactive' to disable this behavior.

When run in this way, characters typed as input are immediately
translated and written out.  The exception is that when an ESCAPE
character is encountered, 'teseq' must wait for the next few characters
before writing anything, so it can decide whether to start an escape
line or a control-character line.

When 'teseq' has a terminal as its output, it is careful to ensure that
it finishes output lines when it is stopped by a signal.  If it was in
the middle of writing a text line, it will write the closing pipe
character '|', followed by a newline.  If it was in the middle of trying
to determine whether it's in a valid escape sequence or just an escape
character followed by other characters, it will assume the latter case,
and translate all the characters it has seen so far.

To force 'teseq' to behave as if it's not connected to a terminal (that
is, to refrain from ensuring lines are finished, or setting
non-canonical/no-echo mode), use the '--no-interactive' ('-I') option.

The 'teseq' program does not take care to finish lines when the output
is not a terminal.

Whether or not 'teseq' is connected to a terminal, it uses unbuffered
I/O by default, unless the input is an ordinary file.  This is so that
each character may be processed as soon as it's seen.  However, this can
result in much longer processing time overall.  To force 'teseq' to
buffer its input and output, use the '--buffered' ('-b') option.

3 Output Format
***************

Teseq produces output that is primarily intended to be read by humans
(from input that is usually not).  For this reason, Teseq output follows
the following principles:

   * Displays for different sorts of characters and sequences are
     displayed on distinct lines, and are easily distinguished by the
     initial character.
   * Every input character should be unambiguously visible to the user
     in the output (except, of course, when the user explicitly asks not
     to see them, as with the '-E' option).  In particular, trailing
     space should be visible.
   * Line lengths are limited to a maximum of 78 characters, so as to
     fit comfortably on most terminal displays.
   * The output makes clear distinction between line breaks that occur
     due to line limits or intermixed character types, and those that
     actually occurred in the input.

*Note Overview::, for an output example.

3.1 Text Lines
==============

Lines of plain text input, are output between a pair of pipe characters
'|', with a final period to indicate the linefeed character.  Input:

     Hello there

Output:

     |Hello there|.

Trailing whitespace is thus made plainly visible to the reader.

     |Trailing space:    |.

A blank line is represented as empty content between the pipes.

     ||.

If the input line is too long to display as one line of output, it will
be displayed as follows, with dash characters, '-', to mark continuity
at the beginnings and ends of the lines (outside the pipe characters).

     |This input line |-
     -|was too long to|-
     -| fit|.

You might wonder whether pipe characters themselves might have to be
escaped, so as to avoid confusion with the surrounding pipes.  After
all, in a C string literal, denoted by double-quotes, '"', one must
escape literal double-quote characters by preceding them with a
backslash (and must then also escape literal backslashes): '"She said
\"no\""'.  However, no such escaping mechanism is needed in Teseq.
Input:

     A line with a pipe | in it, and a line with just a pipe
     |

Output:

     |A line with a pipe | in it, and a line with just a pipe|.
     |||.

No special treatment whatsoever!

The reason Teseq can get away with this is that the pipe character only
has its special "mark the enclosed as normal text" meaning, when it is
the first and the last character on a line of output (aside from a
possible prefacing dash to indicate a wrapped line, or a trailing dash
or period).

A lot of the output lines you've seen so far have all ended with a
period, denoting the linefeed character.  However, this isn't always the
case.  For instance, if the input line contains a control character,
Teseq will close the text line (with just a pipe, no period), print a
control-character line with the control characters, and then finish up
the rest of the text line.  The following sample output represents a
single line which contains a delete character and a null character:

     |Fee fi|
     . DEL/^?
     |fo|
     . NUL/^@
     |fum|.

And here's a line that's terminated with a carriage-return/line-feed
combination, rather than just a linefeed.

     |The promised line|
     . CR/^M LF/^J

The linefeed character is special: when it's preceded by control
characters or escape sequence, it's printed as a control character; when
it's preceded by text characters (or by nothing at all), it's printed as
that final dot thing.  This behavior is designed to make a newline look
like the end of a line or a blank line when it should, and to look like
a control character when it should.

And of course, if the final line in the file is missing a newline, the
dot won't appear there either.

Currently, the only characters included in text lines, are those from
the printable range of characters from US ASCII (Ecma-6 / ISO 646)--and
sometimes linefeed, represented by the special final-dot notation.  This
means that if the terminal was using a character set that high-value
code points, all high-valued bytes will be represented in hexadecimal on
control-character lines, and not displayed on a text line.  Future
versions of Teseq may provide options allowing for these characters to
be represented properly in text lines, but for now, the output format is
ASCII characters only.  *Note Future Enhancements::.

Note that even characters falling in the normal range of ASCII printable
characters may not necessarily be represented correctly: for instance,
if escape codes are present in the input that would switch the terminal
to a different national variant of Ecma-6 / ISO 646, then the real
terminal might display (say, for ISO-646ES) the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N
WITH TILDE instead of '['; but the output from Teseq will not change
based on this (even though it will recognize and identify the control
sequences that invoke that character set for use).

3.2 Control-Character Lines
===========================

Control-character lines are used to display characters whose code values
fall outside the range of printable characters from US ASCII (Ecma-6 /
ISO 646).  That is, those characters whose code values fall below below
32 decimal (those from the C0 set of control characters from Ecma-48 /
ISO/IEC 6429); and those whose values are at or above 127 decimal (the
"delete" character, and character byte values with the high bit set).

Control-character lines begin with an initial dot, '.', followed by the
control characters or high-value bytes being represented.

     . BEL/^G NUL/^ CR/^M LF/^J DEL/^? xA0 xFF

Control characters (whose numeric codes fall below decimal 32, plus the
delete character at decimal 127) are represented by a mnemonic acronym
identifying the character's function.  Unless the '-C' was given, this
acronym is followed by a slash, and the control-key combination that
would produce the corresponding character (control characters are
usually much more recognizable from one or the other of their name or
their control-character representation, than they are by their
hexadecimal code value).  The "control-key combination" representation
consists of a "hat" or "circumflex accent" character, followed by a
character with a value in the range of 63 through 95 decimal.

Note that the delete character, designated as 'DEL/^?', is a special
case, in that one can not generally reproduce that key by holding down
the control key and typing a question mark; it is simply used as an
identification of the key.

Other values (high-value bytes) are represented by the lowercase letter
'x' followed by the two-digit hexadecimal code value for the character.

For reference, here's a table of the control characters (plus DEL).  It
is based on the information from Table 1 of Ecma-48 / ISO/IEC 6429 (the
control-key representation has been added).

Hex     Key     Name           Hex     Key     Name

x0E     ^N      SO             x1E     ^^      IS2
x0F     ^O      SI             x1F     ^_      IS1
x7F     ^?      DEL

3.3 Escape-Sequence Lines
=========================

Escape-sequence lines, which begin with the colon, ':', don't add any
new semantics--any characters in an escape-sequence line could be
represented on control-character and text lines (and, with just a
one-character change in the escape sequence, would be).  But they serve
to set escape sequences apart from normal control-character or text
lines, making it easier to see on one line all the characters that
contribute to a single control function, rather than splitting them
between control-character and text lines.  Here's an example with some
intermixed escape-sequence and text lines (without the usual label and
description lines, which are described in later sections):

     |Well |
     : Esc [ 3 ; 31 m
     |Daniel|
     : Esc [ 23 ; 39 m
     | didn't do it...|.

The two escape-sequence lines represent, respectively, controls that set
text rendering to use italics in the color red, and to set normal font
rendering in the default color (the actual interpretation of these
controls may vary by application).

Note that the escape-sequence lines include control characters (well,
character, namely 'Esc') intermixed with normal text characters.  So the
above could have been written like:

     |Well |
     . ESC
     |[3;31mDaniel|
     . ESC
     |[23;39m didn't do it...|.

But this loses the separation between characters that, yes, happen to be
text characters, but really just contribute to some terminal control
function invocation, and characters that are, really and truly, text.

     : Esc [ 3 ; 31 m

Some things to note.  First, the escape key is noted as 'Esc', and not
'ESC' as it would be in a control-character line.  Don't ask me why;
maybe I just felt it was one more thing to dilineate between
escape-sequence lines and control-character lines.

Also, each character is separated from its neighbors by a single space,
except that strings of digits are lumped all together.

Each character is represented by itself (including colon, as long as
it's not at the start of the line), except the escape character, and the
space character (represented as 'Spc').  Control characters and
high-value bytes are not currently represented on escape-sequence lines
(they are not part of any escape sequences Teseq recognizes), but if
they are in the future (say, as part of non-standardized escape
sequences), they will most likely be represented as 'xXX' hexadecimal
strings (as high-value bytes are represented in control-character lines.

If an escape sequence requires more than one output line, the continuing
lines will also begin with a colon, followed by two spaces (instead of
one).  Lines will not be split in the middle of a number.

     : Esc [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4
     :  ; 5 ; 6 ; 7 m

Recognizing Escape Sequences
----------------------------

Okay, great, so escape-sequence lines help distinguish
control-characters and text characters that make up an escape sequence
from those that don't.  But what exactly makes up an escape sequence,
anyway?

The Ecma-35 / ISO/IEC 2022 standard defines an escape sequence to be a
sequence of characters beginning with ESC, with a final byte in the
range 'x30'-'x7E', and any number (including zero) of intermediate bytes
in the range 'x20'-'x2F'.  The following table has been provided as a
reference for finding which characters match which codes.

         x2X   x3X   x4X   x5X   x6X   x7X
---------------------------------------------
xX0  |   SPC   0     @     P     '     p
xX1  |   !     1     A     Q     a     q
xX2  |   "     2     B     R     b     r
xX3  |   #     3     C     S     c     s
xX4  |   $     4     D     T     d     t
xX5  |   %     5     E     U     e     u
xX6  |   &     6     F     V     f     v
xX7  |   '     7     G     W     g     w
xX8  |   (     8     H     X     h     x
xX9  |   )     9     I     Y     i     y
xXA  |   *     :     J     Z     j     z
xXB  |   +     ;     K     [     k     {
xXC  |   ,     <     L     \     l     |
xXD  |   -     =     M     ]     m     }
xXE  |   .     >     N     ^     n     ~
xXF  |   /     ?     O     _     o     DEL

Table 3.1

So, for instance, the following is a valid escape sequence.

     : Esc $ ( C

'$' and '(' have code values 'x24' and 'x28', and so are valid
intermediate bytes; 'C' has the value 'x43', and so terminates the
escape sequence.

You may have noticed that a lot of the examples of escape sequences in
this document don't actually follow this format.  For instance,

     : Esc [ 3 ; 31 m

According to the definition we just gave, '[' should be the final byte
of an escape sequence.  So why does Teseq keep going until it reaches
the 'm'?

The answer is that the escape sequence _does_ end with the '['; but the
combination 'Esc [' invokes a control named 'CONTROL SEQUENCE
INTRODUCER' (CSI).  The CSI control marks the beginning of a different
kind of sequence, called a "control sequence".  Control sequences are
described by the Ecma-48 / ISO/IEC 6429 standard, which considers it to
be a distinct concept from escape sequences; however, Teseq treats both
types of sequences as "escape sequences".

A control sequence starts with the two-character CSI escape sequence
'Esc [', followed by an optional sequence of parameter bytes in the
range 'x30'-'x3F', an optional sequence of intermediate bytes in the
range 'x20'-'x2F' (the same range as intermediate bytes in a regular
escape sequence), and a final byte in the range 'x40'-'x7e'.  The set of
standard control sequence functions are defined in Ecma-48 /
ISO/IEC 6429.

When used in accordance with the standard, the parameter bytes are used
to provide a semicolon-separated list of numeric parameters to the
control function being invoked.  These affect the details of the control
function's behavior; but not which control function is being invoked:

     : Esc [ 1 m
     & SGR: SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION
     " Set bold text.
     : Esc [ 0 m
     & SGR: SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION
     " Clear graphic rendition to defaults.

Both sequences end with the same sequence of intermediate bytes (none)
and final byte; both invoke the SGR control function.  But the first one
indicates that following text should be rendered boldface, while the
second indicates that text rendering should be restored to its default
settings.

Intermediate bytes, however, together with the final byte, _do_ affect
the meaning of the function invoked.  Currently, Ecma-48 / ISO/IEC 6429
only defines functions for either no intermediate bytes, or a single
space character ('x20') as the intermediate byte.

     : Esc [ A
     & CUU: CURSOR UP
     : Esc [ Spc A
     & SR: SCROLL RIGHT

Ecma-48 / ISO/IEC 6429 describes an alternate representation for CSI;
the 8-bit byte value 'x9B'.  Teseq does not currently treat that value
specially, nor any of the other high-value bytes from the C1 set of
control functions.  This is because whether or not those bytes indicate
control functions is dependent upon what character encoding is in use.
Future versions of Teseq may support an option to interpret these forms
as well, at which time control sequences using the single-byte CSI
control will probably be rendered like:

     : CSI [ 1 m

Ecma-48 / ISO/IEC 6429 also describes another kind of sequence called
"control strings".  These are not interpreted by Teseq; the control
characters involved (for example, 'SOS/^X' and 'ST/^\') will be printed
on control-character lines, and any text characters will be displayed on
text lines.

Future versions of Teseq will probably not depart from this display
behavior; however, support for some common interpretations for control
strings may be added, in which case a label line and/or description line
might follow the control string, describing its usual interpretation.

3.4 Label Lines
===============

Label lines begin with the ampersand, '&':

     & SGR: SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION

Label lines always describe a control function, and are always preceded
by the escape sequence that invokes that function (unless the '-E'
option was given, suppressing output for escape-sequence lines).

The format of a label line's content is always ACRONYM: NAME; both of
these are defined for each control function by Ecma-48 / ISO/IEC 6429.
In some cases, they may also name private functions defined by popular
terminals and terminal emulators.

Label lines currently are never wrapped; however, future versions of
Teseq may wrap label lines.  At that time, continuation label lines will
probably consist of an extra space after the ampersand (similar to how
escape-sequence lines are wrapped).  Lines will never be split in the
middle of a word.

Future versions of Teseq may use label lines to describe things besides
escape sequences; for instance, control characters or control strings,
or other strings that may be interpreted specially by some devices or
applications.

3.5 Description Lines
=====================

Description lines begin with the double-quote, '"':

     " Move the cursor up 2 lines.

Sequences of description lines are generally preceded by a label line
(unless the '-L' option was supplied), and describe the same control
function labeled by that line.  More than one description line may be
used to describe a function, whereas only one label line is ever used
for a control function.

It is important to understand that the descriptions provided are only
approximations and guesses, and suffer from various limitations.  The
behavior of many control functions are dependent on terminal state that
Teseq does not track.  Teseq chooses a common default setting for
applicable terminal modes, and issues a description based on that.  For
instance, the INSERT LINE function is described as follows:

     : Esc [ 2 L
     & IL: INSERT LINE
     " Shift lines after the cursor to make room for 2 new lines.

However, depending on the current setting of the LINE EDITING MODE, the
actual behavior might be to shift the lines _before_ the cursor, rather
than the ones after.  Future versions of Teseq may track enough terminal
state to improve the accuracy of these descriptions (*note Future
Enhancements::), but they would still need to guess at the initial state
of the terminal, for any modes that had not been explicitly set or
reset.

Descriptions are also often inaccurate.  For instance, the description
for INSERT LINE should really read "shift the current line and the lines
after the cursor...".  In addition, no mention is made of the fact that
the extent of the shifted part is dependent on previous invocations of
SELECT EDITING EXTENT.  A conscious decision has been made to value
brevity over accuracy.

Also, the descriptions are based (loosely) on the semantics defined by
Ecma-48 / ISO/IEC 6429.  There is no guarantee that this corresponds to
the semantics defined for the actual terminal on which these functions
were invoked.  The terminal may have different behavior, or may not even
accept the function.  The descriptions are intended as a rough aid in
remembering what a given function does; to really understand the actual
semantics of a function, you should read the terminal device's
documentation, and/or Ecma-48 / ISO/IEC 6429.

Future versions of Teseq may use description lines to describe things
besides escape sequences; for instance, control characters or control
strings, or other strings that may be interpreted specially by some
devices or applications.

Some description lines may appear without a preceding label line (even
when '-L' was not specified), in the event that no standard designation
for the function is known.

3.6 Delay Lines and Halt Lines
==============================

A delay line begins with an "at" sign '@', and contains a single numeric
value; a number of seconds to pause before continuing on to process
further lines.  The 'reseq' program will obey these instructions only if
it is given the '--replay' option.

     @ 3.0051

Delay lines are only issued by 'teseq' when it has been given the '-t'
option, which uses a timing file from 'script -t' to determine where to
insert delays.  Aside from that, delay lines can be useful for manual
insertion into Teseq output, to introduce a delay at a particular point
when using 'reseq --replay', which can aid in giving the user time to
more easily observe terminal behavior.

If a line begins with three "at" signs together '@@@', and 'reseq' is
invoked with both '--replay' _and_ '--halts', then 'reseq' will pause at
this location until the user presses a key to indicate continuation.
The remainder of the line will be ignored, so can be used for comments.

Such a line will never be output by 'teseq'; it must be inserted by the
user.  Since 'reseq' does not give any indication to the user that it is
awaiting input (as opposed to simply waiting on a length delay line), it
is highly advisable to insert this "halt" line only after a spot in the
recorded terminal script that already provides such an indication.

The halt line can be useful for creating animated demonstrations of
program usage, and similar sorts of presentation-oriented scripts.

4 Color Mode
************

Teseq can provide color formatting to its output.  This feature is
disabled by default, but can be activated via '--color=auto' or
'--color=always'.  If 'auto' is used, then color will be added to the
output only if the output is to a terminal; otherwise not.  If 'always'
is specified, then color formatting codes will be provided for the
output unconditionally.  Note that such output may not be fed to
'reseq', which will not be able to handle these codes.

The default colors used are suitable for use against a dark/black
background, but may be less suitable for use on terminals with
light-colored backgrounds.  The colors used may be altered by setting
the environment variable 'TESEQ_COLORS'.  It consists of comma-separated
key=value pairs, where the key is usually the prefix character of the
line to be colored, and the value consists of parameter values for the
terminal SGR control.  Any prefixes not specified in 'TESEQ_COLORS'
retain their default values.

In the case of text lines, in which literal text is bracketed by pipe
characters ('|'), color may be specified separately for the inner text,
and for the bracketing pipes, including the '|-' and '-|' around
formatting (non-literal) line breaks, and any final '.' signifying a
literal line break.  The inner text is specified by the key '|>', while
the decorations are specified by the key '|'.  Currently, no default
color settings are made for the decorations; only the inner text.

Here is an example setting for TESEQ_COLORS:

     TESEQ_COLORS='|>=36;7,|=1,.=31,:=33,&=35,"=32,3=4'

This sets the literal text content of text lines to a cyan foreground,
and then standout (reverse) mode, so that the result is a cyan
background with a foreground of whatever the usual background would be
(i.e., if the background is normally black, then the foreground will be
black).  The color of the text line decorations is not changed, but the
decorations are displayed in bold.  Control lines ('.') are set to red,
escape-sequence lines (':') are set to amber, label lines ('&') to
violet, descriptions ('"') to green, and delay lines ('@') to blue.

Note that halt lines (lines consisting of exactly '@@@'), though
recognized by reseq, are never emitted by teseq, and thus have no means
of specification in 'TESEQ_COLORS'.

5 The Reseq Command
*******************

Synopsis:

     reseq [-t|--timings=TIMINGS] INPUT OUTPUT
     reseq --replay [-d DIVISOR] INPUT [OUTPUT]
     reseq -h | --help
     reseq -V | --version

The INPUT and OUTPUT arguments are mandatory, but may be specified as
'-' for standard input or output.  Reseq doesn't let output default to
standard output because, since it generates raw terminal codes, it is
uncommon (and potentially unsafe) to send this directly to the terminal.
The exception is when the '--replay' argument has been specified, which
is only useful when output is going to the terminal; in that event, the
OUTPUT argument is optional.

'-h'
'--help'
     Print usage information on standard output and exit successfully.

'-V'
'--version'
     Print the version number and licensing information of 'hello' on
     standard output and then exit successfully.

'--replay'
     Honor delay lines in the input, pausing the specified amount of
     time before continuing to process the next line.  This is useful
     for producing behavior equivalent to that of the 'scriptreplay'
     command (from util-linux
     (http://userweb.kernel.org/~kzak/util-linux-ng/)), but using a
     Teseq output file as input, rather than a raw typescript file.

'--halts'
     Only takes effect if '--replay' is also specified.  In addition to
     honoring delay lines, also honors user-inserted "halt" lines (those
     beginning with '@@@') in the input.  These lines cause 'reseq' to
     halt processing until the user presses a key.

     This halting action is not accompanied by any sort of indication
     that 'reseq' is awaiting user action; it is up to the user to
     ensure that the input script to 'reseq' has included some sort of
     appropriate indication.

     When '--halts' is in effect, 'reseq' will turn off terminal echoing
     (so the user's keypress to continue the script is not shown), and
     switches the terminal over to unbuffered I/O, so that keypresses
     can be read as soon as they are typed.

'-t TIMINGS'
'--timings TIMINGS'
     Produce timing information from delay lines, in the format
     generated by 'script -t'.  This can be used to regenerate 'script'
     typescript and timing files that were fed as the input to 'teseq -t
     timings'.  Note that the result will differ slightly from the
     output from 'script -t', in that the first delay will be zeroed out
     ('teseq' always throws out the first delay value, whose value from
     script is an arbitrary value between 0 and 1), and the last delay
     line will include all the remaining characters ('script''s timings
     don't count the final timestamp line).

The 'reseq' command essentially does the reverse of 'teseq'.  If you
feed it the output from 'teseq', it will generate the corresponding
escape sequences--that is, it will generate the same content that was
fed to 'teseq' to produce that output.  The shell command

     $ teseq foo | reseq - -

is roughly equivalent to

     $ cat foo

The 'reseq' command is written in Perl, unlike 'teseq' which is compiled
from C-language sources, and so requires a Perl interpreter to be
present in order to function.

Of the various types of lines output by the 'teseq' command, 'reseq'
only understands four; text lines:

     |Hello, there|.
     |Here are|-
     -|some wrapped|-
     -|lines|.

control-character lines:

     . CR/^M LF/^J
     . CR LF

escape-sequence lines:

     : Esc [ 31 ; 3 m

And, of course, delay lines:

     @ 3.14159

Reserved Line Prefixes
======================

It's important for 'reseq' to be able to process its input correctly,
even if that output came from a different version of 'teseq' than
'reseq' is familiar with.  So, it's important that 'reseq' should refuse
to continue processing input if it encounters a line that it doesn't
recognize, but which might contain important semantic information that
effects the output 'reseq' should produce.

At the same time, it'd be a shame for 'reseq' to refuse to process a
line it doesn't understand, if that line contains non-critical
information.  For example, consider delay lines (beginning with '@').
The delay line holds semantic information, to be sure; but not
information that would affect 'reseq''s normal operation (it only has
meaning when one of the '--timings' or '--replay' options has been
specified).  So, if an older version of 'reseq' had existed that did not
recognize them, it would have been a shame if its introduction in the
newer release had caused the older version to refuse to process it.

To address both of these concerns, 'reseq' has taken the approach of
reserving certain prefixes for use as "semantically significant" line
prefixes, and others for use in lines that 'reseq' can safely ignore.  A
line that begins with any of the following characters, will cause
'reseq' to halt processing and exit with an error.

     !$+/=[\^{~

The idea is that these prefixes are reserved for future use in lines
that 'reseq' must understand in order to produce correct results.

This leaves all remaining characters free for use in specifying future
'teseq' output lines that do not affect processing for older 'reseq's.
Note that they are still reserved for 'teseq', and are not intended for
users to insert commentary or such.  However, 'teseq' will never use a
line beginning with the space character; and 'reseq' will always ignore
such lines, so the space character may be used to indicate user
comments.

6 Standards
***********

The most authoritative source of information on control functions, their
representations in bytes, and their intended meaning, is the Ecma-48 /
ISO/IEC 6429 standard.  Also related is the Ecma-35 / ISO/IEC 2022
standard, which describes control functions for switching the character
encoding, and defines the possible forms of escape sequence (note that,
in Teseq, "escape sequence" refers to both the Ecma-48 concept of
"control sequences", and the official Ecma-35 meaning of "escape
sequence".  These standards are available, "free of charge and
copyright", at:

     <http://www.ecma-international.org/>.

Teseq also recognizes some additional sequences that were not defined by
international standard, but are in fairly wide use.  In such cases, if
descriptions are enabled, the description text for these sequences will
be prefixed by a tag in parentheses that identifies where this
functionality is found.  For instance, '(DEC)' for sequences used in DEC
equipment such as the VT100, or '(Xterm)' for squences supported by
xterm.  Sources of information that were used for identifying and
describing these sequences, include:

     <http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html>
     <http://www.vt100.net/>.

7 Future Enhancements
*********************

Here are some potential additions that may appear in future versions of
Teseq.

7.1 Localized Messages
======================

It is expected that a near release of Teseq will include support for
native-language translations of control label names and descriptions.
Note that the acronym portions of label lines will never be translated:
they represent official designations for their respective controls.

An important requirement of such translations is that they must not
interfere with processing of the document; if they use a shift-based
encoding, they will shift to the translation encoding only after the
line prefix, which must be a plain ASCII character, and shift back to
normal ASCII prior to the end of the line.  Bytes with values
corresponding to the ASCII control characters NUL, CR, or LF
(hexadecimal 'x00', 'x0D', and '0x0A') will not appear, except when they
represent their ASCII functions (in no case will NULs be present in the
document).

These requirements rule out the use of wide-character encodings such as
UCS-2 or UTF-16, which could not be intermixed with ascii characters and
which have character representations that would enclude byte values
corresponding to the forbidden characters noted above, but should be
compatible with UTF-8, ISO 2022-based encodings such as the ISO 8859
series, ISO 2022-JP, or EUC-JP and other encodings that meet these
requirements such as GBK, Big5, or Shift JIS.

7.2 Stateful Processing
=======================

Future versions of Teseq may support options to remember state
information about the terminal.  For instance if Teseq has seen the
invocation of SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION to set underlined text, Teseq
might render any further text that appears in with underlining.  In
addition, the meaning of some standardized commands defined by Ecma-48 /
ISO/IEC 6429 depend on the current setting of various terminal modes,
and Teseq currently makes assumptions about those modes.  A
state-remembering Teseq might remember the last time a mode was set, and
no longer need to make assumptions.

If Teseq is given information about the size of the target terminal, it
could also provide information about the cursor's present location after
every cursor-moving command.

Currently, all output from 'teseq' is in US ASCII; but future versions
of Teseq might support output in other encodings.  If that happens,
Teseq might also add support for the handling of Ecma-35 / ISO/IEC 2022
character code-switching sequences, such that the characters given in
text lines would reflect the actual characters as they would actually
appear in the terminal device, depending on the current encoding state.

Note that features which alter the bytes found between the pipe
characters of a text line, would most likely break reverse-translation
with 'reseq', as it would be much harder to tell what the original byte
values had been.

7.3 Terminal Database Awareness
===============================

Future versions of Teseq may allow the user to specify the name of the
terminal for which the input was intended, which Teseq will then use to
detect when a feature from that terminal's entry in the terminal
database (for example, the terminfo database) has been invoked.

Since features from terminal database entries often involve multiple
Ecma-48 / ISO/IEC 6429 controls, Teseq would probably need to indicate
out-of-band "start" and "end" markers for the feature.  For instance, if
the definition for the 'clear' feature for the specified terminal is
'\E[H\E[J', then an input string of '\E[m\E[H\E[J\E(B' might result in
output like:

     : Esc [ m
     # start: clear
     : Esc [ H
     : Esc [ J
     # end: clear
     : Esc ( B

(Label and description lines have been removed from this example.)

No commitment has been made to any particular output format for this
feature; the above is intended purely as an example of one possible
approach.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
     so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
