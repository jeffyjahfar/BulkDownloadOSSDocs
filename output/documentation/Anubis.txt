GNU Anubis
**********

This edition of the `GNU Anubis Manual', last updated 23 May 2014,
documents GNU Anubis Version 4.2.

1 Overview
**********

GNU Anubis is an SMTP message submission daemon. Its purpose is to
receive outgoing messages, optionally perform some manipulations over
their content, and to forward altered messages to the mail transport
agent.

   A usual mail sending scheme looks as follows: the user composes his
message using "mail user agent" ("MUA" for short). Once the message is
composed, the user sends it. While sending, the MUA connects to the
"mail transport agent" ("MTA" for short) and passes it the message for
delivery. The figure below illustrates this interaction:

     +-------+                 +-------+
     |  MUA  | ---[outmsg]---> |  MTA  | ... [outmsg]
     +-------+                 +-------+         |
                                                 |
                                                 V
                                          +--------------+
                                          |  Recipient's |
                                          |   Mailbox    |
                                          +--------------+

   As shown in this figure, outgoing message ("outmsg") reaches the
recipient's mailbox unaltered.

   However, there are situations where it may be necessary to modify
the outgoing message before it reaches MTA. For example, the user might
wish to sign outgoing messages with his PGP key, because his MUA does
not support this operation.

   In such cases, installing GNU Anubis between the MUA and MTA allows
the user to perform additional processing on the sent message. The
figure below illustrates this concept:

     +-------+                 +--------+                 +-------+
     |  MUA  | ---[outmsg]---> | Anubis | ---[modmsg]---> |  MTA  |
     +-------+                 +--------+                 +-------+
                                                              |
                                                           [modmsg]
                                                              .
                                                              .
                                                              V
                                                       +--------------+
                                                       |  Recipient's |
                                                       |   Mailbox    |
                                                       +--------------+

   The outgoing message is modified by GNU Anubis, and it is the
resulting message ("modmsg") that reaches the MTA.

   GNU Anubis is able to perform a wide set of operations on messages,
such as modifying headers or body, encrypting or signing messages with
GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys, installing secure tunnels to MTA using
TLS/SSL encryption, tunneling messages through SOCKS proxies, etc.

   When the set of built-in operations is not enough, administrators can
define new ones using Guile, a "GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language
for Extensions".

   Apart from configurable operations, GNU Anubis always performs "SMTP
session normalization", a process that ensures that the SMTP stream
coming out of Anubis complies with the RFC 2821, even if the incoming
stream does not. In particular, Anubis removes any extra whitespace
appearing between `MAIL FROM:' or `SMTP TO' command and its argument.

   Message processing is controlled by two configuration files: a
system-wide one that affects functionality of the system as a whole,
and user configuration files, which modify Anubis behaviour on a
per-user basis.

2 Glossary of Frequently Used Terms
***********************************

"Authentication"
     A process whereby Anubis determines authenticity of the connecting
     party, its user name and configuration settings.

"Protocol"
     A standard for information exchange. Protocol defines specific
     wording and control flow for communications between two or more
     programs, devices or systems.

"SMTP"
     Simple Mail Transport Protocol is a common mechanism for exchanging
     mail across a network. This was described initially in RFC 821,
     and subsequently extended by more documents, the most recent one
     being RFC 5321.

"Daemon"
     A process that runs in the background, doing automated processing.

"Server"
     A server provides information or other services for its clients.
     Most network protocols are client-server based. This term often
     refers to hardware, but it can also refer (and we're using it that
     way) to a particular program or process, on that machine, which
     provides the service.

"Proxy"
     A program, which goes between MUA and MTA. It can be used as a
     gateway to the outside world, while using a firewall. In this case
     a host under the firewall sends data to the proxy server, which in
     turn forwards it to a server outside, receives its replies, and
     passes them back to the internal host.

"Guile"
     GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions. It provides a
     Scheme interpreter conforming to the R5RS language specification.
     GNU Anubis uses Guile as its extension language.  For more
     information about Guile, *note Overview: (guile)Top.

"GPG"
     GNU Privacy Guard, a tool compatible with "PGP" ("Pretty Good
     Privacy").

3 Authentication
****************

When GNU Anubis accepts incoming connection, it first has to identify
the remote party, i.e. to determine whether it is authorised to use
Anubis resources and, if so, what configuration settings to use during
the session. We call this process "authentication".  The exact method
of authentication depends on Anubis "operation mode". Currently there
are three modes:

proxy
     No authentication is performed.  Anubis switches to the
     unprivileged user (*note user-unprivileged: Security Settings.)
     and acts as an "SMTP proxy".

transparent
     Anubis relies on AUTH service (`identd') to authenticate users.
     This is the default mode. It is compatible with versions of GNU
     Anubis up to 3.6.2.

auth
     This mode uses SMTP AUTH mechanism to authenticate incoming
     connections. *Note Pixie-Dixie::, original description of this
     mode.

   Both modes have their advantages and deficiencies, which you need to
weigh carefully before choosing which one to use. They are discussed
below:

Transparent (`traditional') mode.
=================================

Deficiencies:
  1. The user must have `identd' installed on his machine.

  2. The user must have a system account on the machine running GNU
     Anubis (though the system administrator may relax this limitation
     by using user name translation, *note TRANSLATION Section::).

Advantages:
  1. Relative simplicity. No user database is necessary.

  2. Authentication is performed immediately after connecting.

Auth mode.
==========

Deficiencies:
  1. A user database is needed

  2. MUAs of the users must be able to perform ESMTP AUTH.(1)

Advantages:
  1. Improved reliability.

  2. Users do not have to run `identd' on their machines.

  3. Users are not required to have accounts on the machine where
     Anubis runs.

  4. Users can remotely modify their configuration files.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) It is not a serious restriction, however. Users may install
Anubis on their machines for the sole purpose of SMTP authentication,
as Pixie-Dixie suggests.

3.1 User Database
=================

A "User Database" is a storage system where GNU Anubis keeps "user
credentials", i.e. data necessary for authenticating and authorizing
users. The exact way of storing these data is described further in this
manual. In this section we treat user database as an abstraction layer.

   The user database consists of "records". Each record keeps
information about a particular "user". A record consists of four
"fields". A field may contain some value, or be empty, in which case we
say that it has "null" value.

   The fields are:

`SMTP AUTHID'
     SMTP authentication ID of the user.

`AUTH PASSWORD'
     SMTP password.

`ACCOUNT'
     System user name.

`CONFIG'
     Path to the configuration file.

   The first two fields are mandatory and must always have non-null
values.  No two records in the database may have the same value of
`SMTP AUTHID' field. When `anubis' is trying to authenticate a user, it
first looks up in the database a record with the value of `SMTP AUTHID'
field matching AUTHID given by the user. If no such entry is found,
authentication fails.  Otherwise, `anubis' goes on and compares the
password supplied by the user with that from `AUTH PASSWORD' field.  If
they match, authentication succeeds and `anubis' passes to
authorization state.

   In this state, it first determines the user ID (UID) to switch to.
If the `ACCOUNT' field is not null, its value is used as account login
name. If it is null, `anubis' uses the privileges of the "default not
privileged user", specified by `user-notprivileged' statement in the
global configuration file (*note user-notprivileged: Security
Settings.).

   The final step is to parse the "user configuration file". If
`CONFIG' field is not null, its value is used as absolute path to the
configuration file. Otherwise, `anubis' searches for file `~/.anubisrc'
(where `~' denotes home directory for the system account obtained on
the previous step) and if such a file exists, loads it.

3.2 Database URL
================

Anubis database is identified by its "URL", or "Universal Resource
Locator". A `URL' consists of following elements (square brackets
enclose optional elements):

     PROTO://[[USER[:PASSWORD]@]HOST]/PATH[PARAMS]

where:

PROTO
     Specifies the database "protocol". The protocol describes how the
     database is to be accessed. In a way, it may be regarded as
     specifying the database "type". Currently, GNU Anubis supports the
     following database protocols:

     `text'        A plain text file with users' credentials.
     `gdbm'        GDBM database
     `mysql'       MySQL database
     `pgsql'       PostgreSQL database
     `postgres'    Alias for `pgsql'.

     These protocols are described in detail below.

USER
     The name of the user authorized to access the database.

PASSWORD
     Password for the above user.

HOST
     Domain name or IP address of a machine running the database.

PATH
     A "path" to the database. The exact meaning of this element
     depends on the database protocol. It is described in detail when
     discussing particular protocols.

PARAMS
     A list of protocol-dependent parameters. Each parameter consists
     of the "parameter name", or "keyword" and its "value" separated by
     a equals sign:

          KEYWORD=NAME

     Multiple parameters are separated by semicolons.

3.2.1 Plain text databases
--------------------------

A simplest database is a plain text file, with lines representing
"records". Empty lines and lines beginning with `#' ("comments") sign
are ignored. A record consists of "fields", separated by colons (`:',
ASCII 58).  If `:' character occurs as a part of a field, it must be
escaped by a single  backslash character (`\\', ASCII 92).  Each record
must contain at least two and no more than four fields:

  1. SMTP `AUTHID'.

  2. SMTP password.

  3. Account name.

  4. Pathname of the user configuration file.

URL syntax
..........

The URL syntax for this type of databases is quite simple:

     text:PATH

where PATH specifies absolute file name of the database file.

3.2.2 Databases in GDBM format
------------------------------

The protocol value `gdbm' specifies a "GDBM database". For the detailed
description of GDBM system *note Introduction: (gdbm)Top.

   Technically speaking, each GDBM record consists of a "key" and
"content". Its `key' holds the value of SMTP `AUTHID', whereas its
`content' holds SMTP password, system account name and path to user
configuration file, separated by commas. As it was with `text'
databases, the two last fields are optional.

   The URL syntax for GDBM databases is:

     gdbm:PATH

where PATH specifies absolute file name of the database file.

3.2.3 MySQL and PostgreSQL
--------------------------

This is the most flexible database format. GNU Anubis 4.2 supports
MySQL(1) and PostgreSQL(2) interfaces.  No matter which of them you
use, the implementation details are hidden behind a single consistent
Anubis interface.

   GNU Anubis supposes that all user data are kept in a single database
table. This table must have at least four columns for storing SMTP
`AUTHID', SMTP password, system account name and path to user
configuration file. Among those, only the last two may have NULL
values. There is no restriction on the name of the database or the
authentication table, nor on its column names. This information may be
specified in URL as discussed below.

URL syntax
..........

     PROTO://[[USER[:PASSWORD]@]HOST/]DBNAME[PARAMS]

   PROTO describes the database type to use. Use `mysql' for MySQL
databases and `pgsql' or `postgres' for PostgreSQL databases.

   Optional USER and PASSWORD specify authentication credentials for
accessing the database.

   HOST sets the domain name or IP address of the machine running the
database. It may be omitted if the database resides on `localhost'.

   The database name is specified by the DBNAME element.

   Further details needed for connecting to the database are given by
URL parameters. All of them have reasonable default values, so you'll
have to specify only those parameters that differ from the default. The
following parameters are defined:

`port=NUMBER'
     Specifies port number the database server is listening on.  If it
     is not given, the behavior depends on the value of the `socket'
     parameter (see below). If `socket' is not present, the program
     will use the default port number for the given protocol (i.e. 3306
     for `mysql' and 5432 for `pgsql'.

`socket=STRING'
     Specifies the UNIX file name of the socket to connect to. This
     parameter cannot be used together with `port' (see above).

`bufsize=NUMBER'
     Sets length of the buffer for storing SQL queries. Default is 1024
     bytes.

`table=STRING'
     Specifies name of the database table with the authentication data.
     Default is `users'.

`authid=STRING'
     Specifies the name of a column in `table' which holds `AUTHID'
     value. Default is `authid'.

`passwd=STRING'
     Specifies the name of a column in `table' which holds the user
     password. Default is `passwd'.

`account=STRING'
     Specifies the name of a column in `table' which holds the name of
     system account to be used for this `AUTHID'. Default is `account'.

`rcfile=STRING'
     Specifies the name of a column in `table' which holds the path to
     the user's configuration file. Default is `rcfile'.


   When using a MySQL database (`mysql://'), database parameters and
access credentials are first read from the file `/etc/my.cnf', if it
exists.  This file called "option file" in `MySQL' parlance (*note
Using Option Files: (mysql)option-files.)  is organized in groups, each
group beginning with the group name in square brackets on a separate
line.  Within a group, each non-empty line consists of a MySQL option
name, optionally followed by an equals sign and the value.  By default,
the values from the `anubis' group are read.

   Two additional parameters are provided to fine-tune this behavior:

`options-file=FILE'
     Read options from FILE instead of `/etc/my.cnf'.  An empty value
     (`options-file='), disables using the options file.

`options-group=NAME'
     Set the name of the group in the MySQL configuration file, from
     which to read configuration options.

3.3 Managing the Database
=========================

Managing the user database is a complex task, which looks differently
from administrator's and user's point of view. Administrators have all
privileges on the database, they can add new records and delete or
modify existing ones. Users, of course, do not have such ample rights.
The only thing a user is able to do is to maintain his own record in
the database, provided that he already has one.

3.3.1 Administrators
--------------------

All administrative tasks are done via the `anubisadm' command -- a
multipurpose tool for Anubis administrators.

   The command usage syntax is:

     anubisadm COMMAND [OPTIONS] DATABASE-URL

where COMMAND specifies the operation to be performed on the database,
OPTIONS give additional operation-specific parameters, and DATABASE-URL
specifies the database to operate upon.

   All administrative tasks can be subdivided into the following five
categories:

   * Creating the Database

   * Listing Database Records

   * Adding New Records

   * Removing Existing Records

   * Modifying Existing Records

3.3.1.1 Creating the Database
.............................

To create a database, use `anubisadm --create' (or `anubisadm -c').
`Anubisadm' will read database entries from the standard input and
write them to the database.  The standard input is supposed to be
formatted as a `text' database (*note text::).

   For example, to create a GDBM database from plain text file
`userlist', use the following command

     anubisadm --create gdbm:/etc/anubis.db < userlist

Similarly, to create an initially empty database, type

     anubisadm --create gdbm:/etc/anubis.db < /dev/null

   _Notice_, that if you use SQL database format, `--create' command
does not imply creating the database structure! So, before running

     anubisadm --create mysql://localhost/dbname < userlist

make sure you create the underlying database structure (including
granting privileges to the `anubis' user), via the usual procedure.
Please refer to corresponding database manual for the detailed
instructions on this.

   It is sometimes necessary to convert an existing user database from
one format (protocol) to another. For example, suppose you have been
running GDBM database (`text:/etc/anubis.db') for some time, but now it
has grown so big that you decided to switch to PostgreSQL database to
improve performance. To do so, first create the database using postgres
utilities. Then run

     anubisadm --list text:/etc/anubis.db | \
      anubisadm --create pgsql://localhost/dbname

That's all there is to it!

3.3.1.2 Listing Database Records
................................

The `--list' (or `-l') option lists the existing database:

     anubisadm --list gdbm:/etc/anubis.db

   By default it displays all records from the database.

   Among its other uses, such invocation is handy for converting user
database to another format (*note Create::).

   If you wish to list only a particular record, specify the `AUTHID'
using `--authid' (`-i') option. For example, to list the record for
`AUTHID' `test', type:

     example$ anubisadm --list --authid test gdbm:/etc/anubis.db

3.3.1.3 Adding New Records
..........................

To add a new record use the `--add' (`-a') option.  Additional data are
specified via the following options:

`-i STRING'
`--authid=STRING'
     Specify the user `SMTP AUTHID'.

`-p STRING'
`--password=STRING'
     Specify the user password.

`-u STRING'
`--user=STRING'
     Specify the system user name for this `AUTHID'.

`-f STRING'
`--rcfile=STRING'
     Specify configuration file to be used for this user.

   For example, the following command adds a record with `SMTP AUTHID'
`test', password `guessme' and maps it to the system account `gray':

     anubisadm --add --authid test --password guessme \
               --user gray gdbm:/etc/anubis.db

3.3.1.4 Removing Existing Records
.................................

Removing a record is quite straightforward: use the `--remove' (`-r')
option and supply the `AUTHID' to delete via the `--authid' option. For
example, to remove the record created in the previous subsection, run:

     anubisadm --remove --authid test gdbm:/etc/anubis.db

3.3.1.5 Modifying Existing Records
..................................

To modify an existing record use the `--modify' (`-m') option. The
record is identified via the `--authid' option. The following options
supply the changed values:

`-p STRING'
`--password=STRING'
     Specify new user password.

`-u STRING'
`--user=STRING'
     Specify new system user name for this `AUTHID'.

`-f STRING'
`--rcfile=STRING'
     Specify the user's configuration file.

   For example, the following command changes the name of configuration
file for the user `smith':

     anubisadm --authid smith \
               --rcfile=/var/spool/anubis/common gdbm:/etc/anubis.db

          be used with `--add', `--modify', and `--remove' commands.

3.3.2 Users
-----------

Users maintain their database records via the `anubisusr' command. We
suggest invoking `anubisusr' from your `~/.profile', which will make
sure that your configuration file is up to date when you log in.  (1).

Usage
.....

     anubisusr [OPTIONS] [SMTP-URL]

where SMTP-URL is a URL of your GNU Anubis server.  Notice that if it
lacks user name and password, then `anubisusr' will first try to
retrieve them from your `~/.netrc' file (*note netrc:
(netrc(5))netrc.), and if not found, it will prompt you to supply them.

Options
.......

`-m MECH'
`--mechanism MECH'
     Use the SASL mechanism MECH. Give this option several times to set
     a list of allowed mechanisms.

`--file=FILE'
`-f FILE'
     Sets the user configuration file name (default is `.anubisrc').

`--netrc+FILE'
`-n FILE'
     Sets the name of the automatic login configuration file (default is
     `.netrc').

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Verbose output. Multiple options increase verbosity. Maximum
     verbosity level is 3.

   Options controlling encryption:

`--disable-tls'
`-d'
     Disable the use of TLS encryption.

`--tls-cafile=FILE'
`-C FILE'
     Sets the name of certificate authority file to use when verifying
     the server certificate.

`--tls-priorities=LIST'
     Sets cipher suite preferences to use.  The LIST argument may
     contain a single initial keyword or be a colon-separated list of
     TLS keywords.  The description of TLS keywords is well beyond the
     scope of this document.  Please refer to *note Priority Strings:
     (gnutls)Priority Strings, for a detailed discussion.

     Default priority list is `NORMAL'.

   Informational options:

`--version'
     Display program version number and exit.

`--help'
     Display short usage summary and exit.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Make sure to run `anubisusr' in background, so it does not slow
down your normal login sequence.

4 Configuration
***************

The behavior of GNU Anubis is controlled by two configuration files.
The "system configuration file", `/etc/anubisrc', supplies system-wide
settings that affect all users. This file is usually owned by root. The
"user configuration file" specifies what GNU Anubis should do for a
particular user. By default it is located in `~/.anubisrc'. This
location can be changed if `anubis' operates in auth mode. The
permissions of a user configuration file must be set to 0600
(u=rw,g=,o=), otherwise GNU Anubis won't accept the file.

Lexical Structure
-----------------

Both configuration files use simple line-oriented syntax. Each line
introduces a single statement. A statement consists of "words", each
word being defined as a contiguous sequence of non-whitespace symbols.
The word may be composed of alphanumeric characters and any of the
following punctuation symbols: `_', `.', `/', `-'. Any arbitrary
sequence of characters enclosed in a pair of double quotes is also
recognized as a word. Such a sequence is called "quoted string".

   Quoted strings follow the same syntax rules as in the C language.  A
backslash character `\' alters the meaning of the character following
it. This special construct is called "escape sequence".  When
processing an escape sequence, Anubis removes it from the string and
replaces it with a single character as described in the following table:

Sequence               Replaced with
\a                     Audible bell character (ASCII 7)
\b                     Backspace character (ASCII 8)
\e                     Escape (ASCII (ASCII 27)
\f                     Form-feed character (ASCII 12)
\n                     Newline character (ASCII 10)
\r                     Carriage return character (ASCII 13)
\t                     Horizontal tabulation character
                       (ASCII 9)
\v                     Vertical tabulation character
                       (ASCII 11)

Table 4.1: Backslash escapes

   A backslash followed by any character not listed above is replaced by
the character alone. This can be used, in particular, for inserting `"'
character within a string, as in the example below:

     "This string contains \"quoted string\"."

   Similarly, a backslash followed by a newline is replaced by the
newline itself. Thus, the following two strings are equivalent:

     "This string is split\nover two lines"

     "This string is split\
     over two lines"

   The familiar shell "here document" syntax can be used to produce a
word containing several lines of text. The syntax is:

     <<[-]delimiter
         text
     delimiter

   If "here document" starts with `<<-', then all leading tab
characters are stripped from input lines and the line containing
"delimiter". This allows to indent here-document in a natural fashion.

   To summarize all the above, let's consider an example:

     first-word "second word" <<-EOT
                                 Third word
                                 containing several
                                 lines of text
                                 EOT

This line contains three words: `first-word', `second word' and the
third one composed of the three lines between the `EOT' markers.

   If a statement is very long, it may be split among several lines of
text. To do so, end each line with a backslash (`\'), immediately
before the newline, as in:

     a very long statement\
       occupying several lines\
       of text

   A `#' in a line starts a "comment". The `#' character and the rest
of the line following it are ignored. Comments may appear anywhere in
the configuration file, except within a command line or a
"here-document" construct. A line containing just a comment (with
optional whitespace before it) is effectively blank, and is ignored.
For example:

     # This is a comment
     if header[Subject] :re "No.*"  # This is also a comment
       guile-process action-name This # is not a comment!!!
     fi

Logical Structure
-----------------

Statements in a configuration file are grouped into "sections". Each
section has its name. A section begins with one of the following
constructs:

     BEGIN NAME
     ---BEGIN NAME---

and ends with one of the following constructs:

     END
     ---END---

   Notice, that both `BEGIN' and `END' must be uppercase.  When using
the second form, any amount of whitespace is allowed between the three
dashes and the word.

   Sections cannot be nested.

   There are five predefined sections, whose names are in uppercase.
The user may define his own sections, which may then be referred to
from the `RULE' section as subroutines (*note Call Action::).

   The predefined section names are:

"AUTH"
     Defines authentication mechanisms.

"CONTROL"
     This section specifies the basic GNU Anubis behavior. Its presence
     is required in the system configuration file. It may be used in
     the user configuration file to override the system-wide settings.

"TRANSLATION"
     This section specifies a translation map for mapping remote user
     names to local ones. It may be used only in the system-wide
     configuration file.

"GUILE"
     Configures the Guile interpreter. This section is allowed in both
     configuration files.

"RULE"
     Defines rules that for altering the message contents.

4.1 AUTH Section
================

The `AUTH' session controls various aspects of authentication mode.

 -- Option: smtp-greeting-message TEXT
     Configures the greeting message issued by GNU Anubis upon accepting
     SMTP connection.

 -- Option: smtp-help-message HELP-TEXT
     Defines the message issued in response to SMTP `HELP' command.
     HELP-TEXT is a list of strings. Each string from the list will be
     displayed on a separate response line.

 -- Option: sasl-password-db URL
     Sets URL of the user database (*note User Database::).

 -- Option: sasl-allowed-mech MECH-LIST
     Defines the list of allowed authentication methods.

 -- Option: sasl-service NAME
     Sets the SASL "service name". It is used, among others, with GSSAPI
     authentication method. Default is `anubis'.

 -- Option: sasl-hostname NAME
     Sets the SASL hostname. By default, the server determines it
     automatically. If it happens to make a wrong guess, you can fix it
     using this directive.

 -- Option: sasl-realm NAME
     Sets the SASL realm. By default, the local domain is used as SASL
     realm (*note local-domain: Basic Settings.).

4.2 CONTROL Section
===================

The `CONTROL' section defines basic GNU Anubis behavior.  If used in
the system-wide configuration file, it applies to all users in the
system. Each user can have a `CONTROL' section in his configuration
file, to customize his personal settings. Of course, not all options
can be set or changed by the user. Some options can only be set in the
system configuration file, and some only in the user configuration
file. By default, options specified in the user configuration file have
a *higher* priority than those specified in system configuration file.

   All option names are case insensitive, so that `bind' or `BIND' or
`BiNd' all refer to the same option.

4.2.1 Basic Settings
--------------------

     (_The information in this node may be obsolete or otherwise
     inaccurate._ This message will disappear, once this node revised.)

 -- Option: bind [HOST:]PORT
     Specify the TCP port on which GNU Anubis listens for connections.
     The default HOST value is `INADDR_ANY', which means that anyone
     can connect to GNU Anubis. The default PORT number is 24 (private
     mail system). This option is available only in the system
     configuration file.

     For example, to bind GNU Anubis to port 25 (SMTP) and limit its
     clients only to those from `localhost', set the following in your
     system configuration file:

          bind localhost:25

 -- Option: remote-mta HOST[:PORT]
     Specify a host name or IP address of the remote SMTP. GNU Anubis
     will forward mails to that server. The default PORT number is 25.
     This option is available in both configuration files.

 -- Option: local-mta FILE-NAME [ARGS]
     Execute a local SMTP server, which works on standard input and
     output (inetd-type program). For example:

          local-mta /usr/sbin/sendmail -bs

     The `CONTROL' section must contain either `local-mta' or
     `remote-mta', but not both.

 -- Option: mode MODE-NAME
     Selects Anubis operation mode. Allowed values for MODE-NAME are:

    proxy

    transparent

    auth

     *Note Authentication::, for the detailed discussion of GNU Anubis
     operation modes.

 -- Option: read-entire-body YES-OR-NO
     Normally, when processing a multi-part message with external
     filter (*note External Processor::), Anubis feeds only the first
     part to the filter. The rest of the message is copied verbatim. To
     alter this behavior so that your external program sees the entire
     message body, set `read-entire-body yes' in your control  section.

 -- Option: incoming-mail-rule STRING
     Declares the name of command section for incoming mail. Default is
     `INCOMING'. This option is available only for system configuration
     file. *Note MDA Mode::, for detailed description of incoming mail
     processing.


 -- Option: outgoing-mail-rule STRING
     Declares the name of command section for outgoing mail. Default is
     `RULE'. This option is available only for system configuration
     file.

 -- Option: smtp-command-rule STRING
     Declares the name of command section for rewriting SMTP commands.
     Default is `SMTP'. This option is available only for system
     configuration file. *Note Modifying SMTP Commands::.

 -- Option: log-tag STRING
     Tag syslog messages with STRING. Default is `anubis'.

 -- Option: log-facility STRING
     Use syslog facility STRING for logging. Valid argument values are:
     `user', `daemon', `auth', `authpriv', `mail', `cron', `local0'
     through `local7' (all names case-insensitive, optionally prefixed
     by `log_'), or a decimal facility number.  Default is `mail'.

 -- Option: local-domain STRING
     Set local domain name.  By default, the domain name is defined as
     the part of the local host name following the first dot.

     Local domain name is used as SASL realm, unless overridden by
     `sasl-realm' statement (*note sasl-realm: AUTH Section.).

4.2.2 Output Settings
---------------------

 -- Option: termlevel LEVEL
     Defines logging verbosity level. Allowed values are:

    normal
          Only errors are logged. This is the default level.

    verbose
          Produce more diagnostic output.

    debug
          Produce debugging output.

    silent
          Do not log anything.

     This command is allowed only in the system configuration file.

 -- Option: logfile FILE-NAME
     This command sets the name of additional log file. GNU Anubis logs
     there messages about user's SMTP session, as defined by the
     `loglevel' statement (see below). For example:

          logfile "anubis.log"

     This will direct additional logging to the `~/anubis.log' file in
     the user's home directory.

 -- Option: loglevel LEVEL
     This option defines verbosity level for the additional log file.
     It may be used only in user configuration file. Allowed values for
     LEVEL are:

    none

    fails
          Log only failure messages.

    all
          Log all relevant messages.

 -- Option: tracefile YES-OR-NO
 -- Option: tracefile FILE-NAME
     This option instructs `anubis' to log the execution of tests and
     actions from the RULE sections. This is useful for debugging
     configuration files.

     When this option is used in the system-wide configuration file,
     only boolean argument is allowed. Using `tracefile yes' enables
     logging of actions and tests to the default syslog channel.  Using
     `tracefile no' disables it.

     When used in the user configuration file, a filename is allowed as
     an argument to this option. This allows you to explicitly specify
     to which file the tracing output should go. Otherwise, using
     `tracefile yes' enables logging to the same file as `logfile' (if
     possible).

 -- Option: HANG DELAY
     _Do not use this option, unless you are developing or debugging
     Anubis!_

     This option instructs each child process to hang for the given
     number of seconds. Before hanging, the process issues the following
     diagnostic message:

          Child process suspended for DELAY seconds

     This option is useful for Anubis developers who wish to attach to
     a child process with debugger. After attaching, set the variable
     `_anubis_hang' to zero to continue processing. You may wish to add
     the following statement to your `.gdbinit' file:

          set variable _anubis_hang=0


4.2.3 SOCKS Proxy
-----------------

 -- Option: socks-proxy HOST[:PORT]
     Enables tunneling incoming connections through a SOCKS proxy
     server, specified as an argument HOST. The default value for PORT
     is 1080, which is a common port number for SOCKS proxies.

 -- Option: socks-v4 YES-OR-NO
     Use SOCKS protocol version 4. By default it is turned off, and
     version 5 of the SOCKS protocol is used.

 -- Option: socks-auth USERNAME:PASSWORD
     Sets user name and password for the SOCKS proxy server.

4.2.4 ESMTP Authentication Settings
-----------------------------------

The following options set authentication credentials for ESMTP
authentication. They are useful, for example, if your MTA requires such
an authentication, but your MUA does not support it.

   You can also use these statements in a `SMTP' section.  *Note
Modifying SMTP Commands::, for a detailed description of this feature.

 -- Option: esmtp-allowed-mech MECH-LIST
     Defines the list of allowed authentication mechanisms. MECH-LIST
     is a list of valid authentication mechanism names separated by
     whitespace.

     Anubis selects the authentication method using the following
     algorithm: MTA presents a list of authentication methods it
     supports.  For each element in MECH-LIST, Anubis tests whether it
     is available in the list presented by MTA. If found, this method is
     selected. For example, suppose that the MTA reports the following
     supported mechanisms:

          PLAIN LOGIN CRAM-MD5 ANONYMOUS

     and in your configuration file you have:

          esmtp-allowed-mech DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 LOGIN

     Then, Anubis will select `CRAM-MD5'.


 -- Option: esmtp-require-encryption MECH-LIST
     Declares the list of mechanisms that can be used only over a TLS
     encrypted channel. By default Anubis uses

          esmtp-require-encryption LOGIN PLAIN

     This prevents sending user password over an unencrypted connection.


 -- Option: esmtp-auth-delayed YES-OR-NO
     By default, ESMTP authentication is attempted as early as
     possible, normally while handling the client `EHLO' command.

     When this statement is set to `yes', authentication is delayed
     until the client issued the `MAIL' command. This will allow
     `anubis' to select authentication credentials depending on the
     sender email. For a detailed description of this feature, see
     *note Modifying SMTP Commands::.

 -- Option: esmtp-auth-id AUTHENTICATION-ID
     Sets authentication ID (user name).

 -- Option: esmtp-authz-id AUTHORIZATION-ID
     Sets authorization ID (user name).

 -- Option: esmtp-password PASSWORD
     Sets ESTMP AUTH password.

 -- Option: esmtp-auth USERNAME:PASSWORD
     This is a shortcut to set both authentication and authorization
     IDs and the password. It is equivalent to

          esmtp-auth-id USERNAME
          esmtp-authz-id USERNAME
          esmtp-password PASSWORD


   The following options specify authentication credentials for GSSAPI,
DIGEST-MD5 and KERBEROS_V5 authentication mechanisms:

 -- Option: esmtp-service SERVICE-NAME
     Sets the name of GSSAPI service.

 -- Option: esmtp-hostname HOSTNAME
     Sets hostname of the machine.

 -- Option: esmtp-generic-service SERVISE-NAME
     Sets generic service name.

 -- Option: esmtp-passcode PASSCODE
     Sets passcode.

 -- Option: esmtp-realm REALM-NAME
     Sets GSSAPI realm.

   The following option is useful with the `ANONYMOUS' authentication
mechanism:

 -- Option: esmtp-anonymous-token TOKEN
     Sets the token to be used with the `ANONYMOUS' authentication
     mechanism

4.2.5 Encryption Settings
-------------------------

 -- Option: ssl YES-OR-NO
     Enable or disable the TLS/SSL encryption between the MUA and the
     MTA. The default is `no', but using the TLS/SSL encryption is
     recommended. You should also set your private key and certificate
     using the `ssl-key' and `ssl-cert' keywords (defined below).

     *Note TLS/SSL::, for details.

 -- Option: ssl-oneway YES-OR-NO
     Enable the "ONEWAY" encryption. Set `ssl-oneway yes', if you want
     to use the TLS/SSL, but your MUA doesn't support ESMTP TLS/SSL.
     Using this option does not require setting the `ssl-key' and
     `ssl-cert' options.

 -- Option: ssl-priorities LIST
     Sets cipher suite preferences to use.  The LIST argument is either
     a single initial keyword or a colon-separated list of TLS
     keywords.  The description of TLS keywords is well beyond the
     scope of this document.  Please refer to *note Priority Strings:
     (gnutls)Priority Strings, for a detailed discussion.

     The default priority list is `NORMAL'.

 -- Option: ssl-cert FILE-NAME
     Specify the certificate for the TLS/SSL encryption.

     Default for FILE-NAME is `anubis.pem'.

 -- Option: ssl-key FILE-NAME
     Set the private key for the TLS/SSL encryption.

     The default FILE-NAME is `anubis.pem'.

 -- Option: ssl-cafile FILE-NAME
     Specify CA certificate file (supported only by GnuTLS).

4.2.6 Security Settings
-----------------------

The following options control various security settings.

 -- Option: drop-unknown-user YES-OR-NO
     If this option is set to `yes', `anubis' drops sessions which
     failed verification by the IDENT service.

     This option is in effect only in `transparent' mode.

     Default is `no'.

 -- Option: user-notprivileged USERNAME
     Defines the "unprivileged" user, i.e. the user with whose
     privileges `anubis' runs most of the time. This option is
     available only in the system configuration file. For example:

          user-notprivileged "anubis"

     *Caution:* This user must exist in the system user database
     (`/etc/passwd').

 -- Option: rule-priority VALUE
     This statement defines the order of execution of the system and
     user `RULE' sections (*Note Rule System::, for a detailed
     description).  It is available only in system configuration file.

     Allowed values are:

    `system'
          First execute the system section, then the user one.

    `user'
          First execute the user section, then the system one.

    `system-only'
          Execute only the system `RULE' section.

    `user-only'
          Execute only the user `RULE' section.

 -- Option: control-priority VALUE
     Sets the order of processing `CONTROL' sections. This option is
     available only in system configuration file.

     Allowed values are:

    `system'
          The system `CONTROL' section is processed first. Notice, that
          this means that the user may override the system settings in
          his configuration file. This is the default setting.

    `user'
          The user `CONTROL' section is processed first. Thus, the
          system-wide settings always override users' private settings.

4.3 TRANSLATION Section
=======================

The `TRANSLATION' section specifies how to translate remote or local
user names, or host names or addresses, to local user names.  The
`TRANSLATION' section is available only in the system configuration
file. The syntax is:

     ---BEGIN TRANSLATION---
     translate  [USER@]ADDRESS into  USERNAME
     ...
     ---END---

   ADDRESS means host name or IP address. You can also specify
`0.0.0.0', and it means any address (`INADDR_ANY').

   For example:

     BEGIN TRANSLATION
     translate jack@example.net into john
     END

This rule will allows the remote user `jack' at `example.net' to use
the configuration file of the local user `john'.

   In the contrast, this statement:
     translate example.net into john
   means that _all_ users at `example.net' are allowed to use the local
john's configuration file.

4.4 GUILE Section
=================

 -- Command: guile-output FILE
     Specifies the name of the file to bind to the Scheme standard error
     and output ports.

     By default both ports are redirected to syslog. The standard error
     port uses the `err' priority, and the standard output port writes
     to the `warning' priority.

     This option has no effect if GNU Anubis is started with either
     `--foreground' or `--stdio' command line option.

 -- Command: guile-debug YES-OR-NO
     When set to `yes', enables Guile stack traces and debugging output.

 -- Command: guile-load-path-append PATH
     Appends the given PATH to the list of Guile load paths (*note
     %load-path: (guile)Build Config.).

 -- Command: guile-load-program FILE
     Reads the given Scheme program.

5 The Rule System
*****************

The rule system is a core part of GNU Anubis. It can be regarded as a
program that is executed for every outgoing message.

   Throughout this chapter, when showing syntax definitions, their
optional parts will be enclosed in a pair of square brackets, e.g.:

     keyword [OPTIONAL-PART] MANDATORY-PART

When the square braces are required symbols, they will be marked as
such, e.g.:

     remove `['KEY`]'

   The rule system is defined in the "RULE" section.  The statements
within this section are executed sequentially.  Each statement is
either an "action" or a "conditional statement".

5.1 Actions
===========

An "action" is a statement defining an operation over the message.
Syntactically, each action is

     COMMAND [=] RIGHT-HAND-SIDE

Where COMMAND specifies the operation and RIGHT-HAND-SIDE specifies its
arguments. The equal sign is optional.

5.2 Conditional Statements
==========================

A "conditional statement" defines control flow within the section.  It
allows to execute arbitrary actions depending on whether a certain
condition is met. The conditional statement in its simplest form is:

     if CONDITION
       ACTION-LIST-1
     fi

   If CONDITION evaluates to true, then the list of statements
ACTION-LIST-1 is executed.

   A simple CONDITION has the following syntax:

     PART [SEP] [OP] [PATTERN-MATCH-FLAGS] REGEX

(square brackets denoting optional parts).  Its parts are:

PART
     Specifies which part of the input should be considered when
     evaluating the condition. It is either `command', meaning the text
     of the SMTP command issued while sending the message, or `header',
     meaning the value of an RFC822 header. Either of the two may be
     followed by the name of the corresponding command or header
     enclosed in square brackets. If this part is missing, all command
     or headers will be searched.

SEP
     Optional "concatenation separator".  *Note Concatenations::, for
     its meaning.

OP
     Either `=', meaning "match", or `!=', meaning "does not match".
     Missing OP is equivalent to `='.

PATTERN-MATCH-FLAGS
     Optional PATTERN-MATCH-FLAGS alter the pattern matching type used
     in subsequent conditional expression. It will be described in
     detail in the section *note Regular Expressions::.

REGEX
     Regular expression enclosed in double quotes.

   The condition yields true if REGEX matches the PART (if OP is `='),
or does not match it (if OP is `!=').

   For example:

     if header [Subject] "^ *Re:"
       ...
     fi

   The actions represented by ... will be executed only if the
`Subject:' header of the message starts with `Re:' optionally preceded
by any amount of whitespace.

   A more elaborate form of the conditional allows you to choose among
the two different action sets depending on a given condition. The
syntax is:

     if CONDITION
       ACTION-LIST-1
     else
       ACTION-LIST-2
     fi

   Here, ACTION-LIST-1 is executed if the CONDITION is met. Otherwise,
ACTION-LIST-2 is executed.

   Note, that both ACTION-LIST-1 and ACTION-LIST-2 can in turn contain
conditionals, so that the conditional statements may be nested. This
allows for creating very sophisticated rule sets. As an example,
consider the following statement:

     if [List-Id] :re ".*<anubis-commit@gnu.org>"
       modify [Subject] "[Anubis Commit Notice] &"
     else
       if [List-Id] :re ".*<bug-anubis@gnu.org>"
         modify [Subject] "[Anubis Bug Notice] &"
       else
         add [X-Passed] "Subject checking"
       fi
     fi

   The effect of this statement is: depending on the value of `List-Id'
header, prepend the `Subject' header with an identification string, or
add an `X-Passed' header if no known `List-Id' was found.

   To simplify writing such nested conditional statements, the `elif'
keyword is provided:

     if CONDITION-1
       ACTION-LIST-1
     elif CONDITION-2
       ACTION-LIST-2
     else
       ACTION-LIST-3
     fi

   This statement is equivalent to:

     if CONDITION
       ACTION-LIST-1
     else
       if CONDITION-2
         ACTION-LIST-2
       else
         ACTION-LIST-3
       fi
     fi

   Any number of `elif' branches may appear in a conditional statement,
the only requirement being that they appear before the `else'
statement, if it is used.

5.2.1 Concatenations
--------------------

It is important to understand that conditional expressions choose the
first match.  To illustrate this, lets suppose you wish to store all
recipient emails from the envelope in the `X-Also-Delivered-To' header.
A naive way to do so is:

     if command [rcpt to:] = "(.*)"
       add header [X-Also-Delivered-To] "\1"
     fi

   However, this will store only the very first `RCPT TO' value, so you
will not achieve your goal.

   To help you in this case, `anubis' offers a "concatenation"
operator, whose effect is to concatenate the values of all requested
keys prior to matching them against the regular expression.
Syntactically, the concatenation operator is a string enclosed in
parentheses, placed right after the key part of a condition.  This
string is used as a separator when concatenating values.  For example:

     if command [rcpt to:] (",") = "(.*)"
       add header [X-Also-Delivered-To] "\1"
     fi

   This fragment will first create a string containing all `RCPT TO'
addresses, separated by commas, and then match it against the regular
expression on the right hand side.  Since this expression matches any
string, the `\1' will contain a comma-separated list of addresses.

5.3 Triggers
============

Triggers are conditional statements that use the value of the `Subject'
header to alter the control flow. Syntactically, a trigger is:

     trigger [FLAGS] PATTERN
       ACTION-LIST
     done

Here, PATTERN is the pattern against which the `Subject' header is
checked, FLAGS are optional flags controlling the type of regular
expression used (*note Regular Expressions::). For backward
compatibility, the keyword `rule' may be used instead of `trigger'.

   The trigger acts as follows: First, the value of the `Subject'
header is matched against the pattern `@@'PATTERN. If it matches, then
the matched part is removed from the `Subject', and the ACTION-LIST is
executed.

   Basically, putting aside the possibility to use different flavors of
regular expressions, a trigger is equivalent to the following statement:

     if header[Subject] :posix "(.*)@@PATTERN"
       modify header [Subject] "\1"
       ACTION-LIST
     fi

   Thus, adding the `@@RULE-NAME' code to the `Subject' header of your
message, triggers a rule named RULE-NAME, specified in a user
configuration file. For example:

     BEGIN RULE
     trigger :basic "^gpg-encrypt-john"
        gpg-encrypt "john's_gpg_key"
     done
     END

Now, if you send an email with the subject ending on
`@@gpg-encrypt-john' (e.g.: `Subject: hello John!@@gpg-encrypt-john'),
it will be encrypted with John's public key. The trigger will remove
the `@@' and the characters following it, so John will only receive a
message with `hello John!' as a subject.

   Another example shows an even more dynamic trigger, that is using a
substitution and back-references:

     ---BEGIN RULE---
     trigger :extended "^gpg-encrypt:(.*)"
        gpg-encrypt "\1"
        add [X-GPG-Comment] "Encrypted for \1"
     done
     ---END---

To encrypt a message to user e.g. `John', simply send an email with a
subject `hello John!@@gpg-encrypt:john's_gpg_key'.  This way, you
decide at a run time which public key should be used, without creating
separate rules for each user.

5.4 Boolean Operators
=====================

The following table lists the boolean operators that can be used in
Anubis conditional expressions in the order of increasing binding
strength:

   * `OR'

   * `AND'

   * `NOT'

   As an example, let's consider the following statement:

     if header[X-Mailer] "mutt" or header[X-Mailer] "mail" \
        and not header[Content-Type] "^multipart/mixed;.*"
        ACTION
     fi

   In this case the ACTION will be executed if the `X-Mailer' header
contains the word `mutt'. The same ACTION will also be executed if the
`X-Mailer' header contains the word `mail' _and_ the value of the
`Content-Type' header does not begin with the string `multipart/mixed'.

   Now, if we wished to execute the ACTION for any message sent using
`mail' or `mutt' whose `Content-Type' header does not begin with the
string `multipart/mixed', we would write the following:

     if (header[X-Mailer] "mutt" or header[X-Mailer] "mail") \
        and not header[Content-Type] "^multipart/mixed;.*"
        ACTION
     fi

Notice the use of parentheses to change the binding strength of the
boolean operators.

5.5 Regular Expressions
=======================

GNU Anubis supports two types of regular expressions: POSIX (both basic
and extended), and Perl-style regular expressions. The former are
always supported, whereas the support for the latter depends on the
configuration settings at compile time. By default POSIX extended
regexps are assumed.

   Regular expressions often contain characters, prefixed with a
backslash (e.g. `\(' in basic POSIX or `\s' in perl-style regexp). Due
to escape substitution (*note Table 4.1: backslash-interpretation.),
you will have to escape the backslash character, e.g. write:

     modify :perl body ["\\stext"] "text"

instead of

     # WRONG!
     modify :perl body ["\stext"] "text"

   However, this rule does not apply to back references, i.e. `"\1"' is
OK.

   A number of modifiers is provided to change the type of regular
expressions. These are described in the following table.

`:regex'
`:re'
     Indicates that the following pattern should be considered a regular
     expression. The default type for this expression is assumed.

`:perl'
`:perlre'
     The regular expression is a Perl-style one.

`:exact'
`:ex'
     Disables regular expression matching, all patterns will be matched
     as exact strings.

`:scase'
     Enables case-sensitive comparison.

`:icase'
     Enables case-insensitive comparison.

`:basic'
     Switches to the POSIX Basic regular expression matching.

`:extended'
     Switches to the POSIX Extended regular expression matching.

   The special statement `regex' allows you to alter the default
regular expression type. For example, the following statement

     regex :perl :scase

   sets the default regular expression types to Perl-style,
case-sensitive.  The settings of `regex' statement regard only those
patterns that appear after it in the configuration file and have force
until the next occurrence of the `regex' statement.

   A couple of examples:

     if header[Subject] :perlre "(?<=(?<!foo)bar)baz"
      ...
     fi

This will match any `Subject' header whose value matches an occurrence
of `baz' that is preceded by `bar' which in turn is not preceded by
`foo'.

     if header[Subject] :scase "^Re"

will match a `Subject' header whose value starts with `Re', but will
not match it if it starts with `RE' or `re'.

   When using POSIX regular expressions, the extended syntax is enabled
by default. If you wish to use a basic regular expression, precede it
with the `:basic' flag.

   For the detailed description of POSIX regular expressions, *Note
Regular Expression Library: (regex)Top.  For information about
Perl-style regular expressions, refer to the Perl documentation.

5.6 Action List
===============

An "action list" is a list of action commands, which control processing
of messages. All action command names are case insensitive, so you can
use for instance: `add' or `ADD' or `AdD', and so on.

5.6.1 Stop Action
-----------------

The `stop' command stops processing of the section immediately. It can
be used in the main `RULE' section as well as in any user-defined
section. For example:

     if not header[Content-Type] "text/plain; .*"
       stop
     fi

5.6.2 Call Action
-----------------

The `call' command invokes a user-defined section much in the same
manner as a subroutine in a programming language. The invoked section
continues to execute until its end or the `stop' statement is
encountered, whichever the first.

     BEGIN myproc
     if header[Subject] "Re: .*"
       stop
     fi
     trigger "pgp"
       gpg-encrypt "my_gpg_key"
     done
     END

     BEGIN RULE
     call myproc
     END

5.6.3 Adding Headers or Text
----------------------------

The `add' command adds arbitrary headers or text to the message. To add
a header, use the following syntax:

 -- Command: add header `['NAME`]' STRING
 -- Command: add `['NAME`]' STRING
     For example:

          add header[X-Comment-1] "GNU's Not Unix!"
          add [X-Comment-2] "Support FSF!"

   To add text to the body of the message, use:

 -- Command: add body TEXT
     Adds the TEXT to the message body. Use of this command with `here
     document' syntax allows to append multi-line text to the message,
     e.g.:

          add body <<-EOT
              Regards,
              Hostmaster
              EOT

5.6.4 Removing Headers
----------------------

The `remove' command removes headers from the message. The syntax is:

 -- Command: remove [FLAGS] header `['STRING`]'
 -- Command: remove [FLAGS] `['STRING`]'
     The name of the header to delete is given by STRING parameter.  By
     default only those headers are removed whose names match it
     exactly.  Optional FLAGS allow to change this behavior. *Note
     Regular Expressions::, for the detailed description of these.

     An example:

          remove ["X-Mailer"]
          remove :regex ["^X-.*"]

     The first example will remove the `X-Mailer:' header from an
     outgoing message, and the second one will remove all "X-*" headers.

5.6.5 Modifying Messages
------------------------

The `modify' command alters headers or body of the message.

 -- Command: modify [FLAGS] header `['KEY`]' `['NEW-KEY`]'
 -- Command: modify [FLAGS] `['KEY`]' `['NEW-KEY`]'
     For each header whose name matches KEY, replaces its name with
     NEW-KEY. If KEY is a regular expressions, NEW-KEY can contain back
     references. For example, the following statement selects all
     headers whose names start with `X-' and changes their names to
     begin with `X-Old-':

          modify header :re ["X-\(.*\)"] ["X-Old-\1"]

 -- Command: modify [FLAGS] header `['KEY`]' VALUE
 -- Command: modify [FLAGS] `['KEY`]' VALUE
     For each header whose name matches KEY, changes its value to
     VALUE. For example:

          modify [Subject] "New subject"

     Every occurrence of unescaped `&' in the new value will be replaced
     by the old header value. To enter the `&' character itself, escape
     it with two backslash characters (`\\'). For example, the
     following statement

          modify [Subject] "[Anubis \\& others] &"

     prepends the `Subject' header with the string `[Anubis & others]'.
     Thus, the header line

          Subject: Test subject

     after having been processed by Anubis, will contain:

          Subject: [Anubis & others] Test subject


 -- Command: modify [FLAGS] header `['KEY`]' `['NEW-KEY`]' VALUE
 -- Command: modify [FLAGS] `['KEY`]' `['NEW-KEY`]' VALUE
     Combines the previous two cases, i.e. changes both the header name
     and its value, as shown in the following example:

          modify header [X-Mailer] [X-X-Mailer] "GNU Anubis"

 -- Command: modify [FLAGS] body `['KEY`]'
     Removes all occurrences of KEY from the message body.  For
     example, this statement will remove every occurrence of the word
     `old':

          modify body ["old"]

 -- Command: modify [FLAGS] body `['KEY`]' STRING
     Replaces all occurrences of KEY with STRING. For example:

          modify body :extended ["the old \([[:alnum:]]+\)"] "the new \1"

5.6.6 Modifying SMTP Commands
-----------------------------

GNU Anubis is able to modify arguments of SMTP commands.  To instruct
it to do so, define a section named `SMTP'.  Anubis will call this
section each time it receives an SMTP command. This section can contain
any statements allowed for `RULE' section, plus the following special
flavor of the `modify' statement:

 -- Command: modify [FLAGS] command `['CMD`]' VALUE
     If the current SMTP command matches CMD, rewrite it by using VALUE
     as its argument.

   For example, this is how to force using `my.host.org' as the `EHLO'
argument:

     BEGIN SMTP
     modify command [ehlo] "my.host.org"
     END

   Additionally, the ESMTP authentication settings (*note ESMTP
Authentication Settings::) can be used as actions in this section.  To
do so, you must first set `esmtp-auth-delayed' to `yes' in the
`CONTROL' section (*note esmtp-auth-delayed: ESMTP Authentication
Settings.).  Changes in the settings take effect if they occur either
before the `MAIL' SMTP command, or while handling this command.

   Consider, for example, the following configuration:

     BEGIN CONTROL
      mode transparent
      bind 25
      remote-mta mail.example.com
      esmtp-auth-delayed yes
     END

     BEGIN SMTP
     if command ["mail from:"] "<smith(\+.*)?@example.net>"
       esmtp-auth-id smith
       esmtp-password guessme
     else
       esmtp-auth no
     fi
     END

   It delays ESMTP authentication until the receipt of the `MAIL'
command from the client. Authentication is used only if the mail is
being sent from <smith@example.net> or any additional mailbox of that
user (e.g. <smith+mbox@example.net>). Otherwise, authentication is
disabled.

   The following points are worth mentioning:

  1. As usual, you may use conditional expressions to decide what to
     modify and how. For example, the code below replaces the domain
     part of each `MAIL FROM' command with `gnu.org':

          BEGIN SMTP
          if command ["mail from:"] "<(.*)@(.*)>(.*)"
            modify command ["mail from:"] "<\1@gnu.org>\2"
          fi
          END

  2. Each `modify command' statement applies only if the current
     command matches its CMD argument. In particular, this means that
     you cannot modify already transferred SMTP commands nor the
     commands to be transferred. For example, the following code will
     not work:

          BEGIN SMTP
          # Wrong!
          if command ["mail from:"] "<>(.*)"
            modify command [ehlo] "domain.net"
          fi
          END

     It is because by the time `MAIL FROM' is received, the `EHLO'
     command has already been processed and sent to the server.

   The final point to notice is that you may use an alternative name for
that section (if you really want to). To do so, define the new name via
the `smtp-command-rule' option in the `CONTROL' section (*note
smtp-command-rule: Basic Settings.).

5.6.7 Inserting Files
---------------------

 -- Command: signature-file-append YES-OR-NO
     This action command adds at the end of a message body the `-- '
     line, and includes a client's `~/.signature' file.

     Default is `no'.

 -- Command: body-append FILE-NAME
     This action command includes at the end of the message body the
     contents of the given file. Unless `FILE-NAME' starts with a `/'
     character, it is taken relative to the current user home directory.

 -- Command: body-clear
     Removes the body of the message.

 -- Command: body-clear-append FILE-NAME
     Replaces the message body with the contents of the specified file.
     The action is equivalent to the following command sequence:

          body-clear
          body-append FILE-NAME

5.6.8 Mail Encryption
---------------------

 -- Command: gpg-passphrase PASSPHRASE
     Specifies your private key's pass phrase for signing messages
     using the GNU Privacy Guard. To protect your passwords from being
     compromised, use the 0600 (u=rw,g=,o=) permissions for the
     configuration file, otherwise GNU Anubis won't accept them.

     We recommend setting the `gpg-passphrase' once in your
     configuration file, e.g. at the start of `RULE' section.

     GNU Anubis support for the GNU Privacy Guard is based on the
     "GnuPG Made Easy" library, available from
     `http://www.gnupg.org/gpgme.html'.

 -- Command: gpg-encrypt GPG-KEYS
     This command enables encrypting messages with the GNU Privacy
     Guard (Pretty Good Privacy) public key(s).  GPG-KEYS is a comma
     separated list of keys (with no space between commas and keys).

          gpg-encrypt "John's public key"

 -- Command: gpg-sign GPG-SIGNER-KEY
 -- Command: gpg-sign `yes-or-default'
     This command signs the message with your GNU Privacy Guard private
     key. Specify a PASSPHRASE with `gpg-passphrase'. Value `default'
     means your default private key, but you can change it if you have
     more than one private key.

     For example:

          gpg-sign default

     or

          gpg-passphrase "my office key passphrase"
          gpg-sign office@example.key

 -- Command: gpg-sign-encrypt GPG-KEYS[:GPG-SIGNER-KEY]
 -- Command: gpg-se GPG-KEYS[:GPG-SIGNER-KEY]
     This command simultaneously signs and encrypts the message.  It
     has the same effect as `gpg' command line switch `-se'. The
     argument before the colon is a comma-separated list of PGP keys to
     encrypt the message with. This argument is mandatory.  The
     GPG-SIGNER-KEY part is optional. In the absence of it, your
     default private key is used.

     For example:

          gpg-sign-encrypt John@example.key

     or

          gpg-se John@example.key:office@example.key

5.6.9 Using an External Processor
---------------------------------

 -- Command: external-body-processor PROGRAM [ARGS]
     Pipes the message body through PROGRAM. The PROGRAM must be a
     filter that reads the text from the standard input and prints the
     transformed text on the standard output. The output from it
     replaces the original body of the message.  ARGS are any
     additional arguments the program may require.

   The amount of data fed to the external program depends on the
message. For plain messages, the entire body is passed. For multi-part
messages, only the first part is passed by default.  This is based on
the assumption that in most multi-part messages the first part contains
textual data, while the rest contains various (mostly non-textual)
attachments. There is a special configuration variable
`read-entire-body' that controls this behavior (*note Basic
Settings::). Setting `read-entire-body yes' in `CONTROL' section of
your configuration file instructs Anubis to pass the entire body of
multi-part messages to your external processor.

   There is a substantial difference between operating in
`read-entire-body no' (the default) and `read-entire-body yes' modes.
When operating in `read-entire-body no', the first part of the message
is decoded and then passed to the external program. In contrast, when
`read-entire-body' is set to `yes', the message is not decoded. Thus,
your external processor must be able to cope with MIME messages.

5.6.10 Quick Example
--------------------

Here is a quick example of an action list:

     ---BEGIN RULE---
     if header [X-Mailer] :re ".*"
        remove [X-Mailer]
        add [X-Comment] "GNU's Not Unix!"
        gpg-sign "my password"
        signature-file-append yes
     fi
     ---END---

The example above removes the `X-Mailer:' header from the message, adds
the `X-Comment:' header, then signs the message with your private key,
and finally adds a signature from the file in your home directory.

5.7 Using Guile Actions
=======================

"Guile" is the "GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions".
It provides a Scheme interpreter conforming to the R5RS language
specification. GNU Anubis uses Guile as its extension language.

   This section describes how to write GNU Anubis actions in Scheme.
It assumes that the reader is sufficiently familiar with the Scheme
language. For information about the language, refer to *note Top:
(r5rs)Top.  For more information about Guile, *Note Overview:
(guile)Top.

5.7.1 Defining Guile Actions
----------------------------

A Guile action is defined as follows:

     (define (FUNCTION-NAME HEADER BODY . REST)
      ...)

Its arguments are:

HEADER
     List of message headers. Each list element is a cons

          (NAME . VALUE)

     where NAME is the name of the header field, and VALUE is its value
     with final CRLF stripped off. Both NAME and VALUE are strings.

BODY
     A string containing the message body.

REST
     Any additional arguments passed to the function from the
     configuration file (*note Invoking Guile Actions::). This argument
     may be absent if the function is not expected to take optional
     arguments.

   The function must return a cons whose car contains the new message
headers, and cdr contains the new message body. If the car is `#t', it
means that no headers are changed. If the cdr is `#t', it means that
the body has not changed. If the cdr is `#f', Anubis will delete the
entire message body.

   As the first example, let's consider a "no-operation" action, i.e.
an action that does not alter the message in any way. It can be written
in two ways:

     (define (noop-1 header body)
       (cons header body))

     (define (noop-2 header body)
       (cons #t #t))

   The following example is a function that deletes the message body
and adds an additional header:

     (define (proc header body)
       (cons (append header
                     (cons "X-Body-Deleted" "yes"))
             #f))

   Let's consider a more constructive example. The following function
checks if the `Subject' header starts with string `ODP:' (a Polish
equivalent to `Re:'), and if it does, replaces it with `Re:'. It also
adds the header

     X-Processed-By: GNU Anubis

Additionally, an optional argument can be used.  If it is given, it will
be appended to the body of the message.

     (define (fix-subject hdr body . rest)
       "If the Subject: field starts with characters \"ODP:\", replace
     them with \"Re:\".
     If REST is not empty, append its car to BODY"
       (cons (append
              (map (lambda (x)
                     (if (and (string-ci=? (car x) "subject")
                              (string-ci=? (substring (cdr x) 0 4) "ODP:"))
                         (cons (car x)
                               (string-append "Re:"
                                              (substring (cdr x) 4)))
                         x))
                   hdr)
              (list (cons "X-Processed-By" "GNU Anubis")))
             (if (null? rest)
                 #t
                 (string-append body "\n" (car rest)))))

5.7.2 Invoking Guile Actions
----------------------------

Guile actions are invoked from the `RULE' section using the
`guile-process' command. Its syntax is:

 -- Scheme Function: FUNCTION ARGS
     Arguments:

    FUNCTION
          The name of the Guile function to be invoked.

    ARGS
          Additional arguments. These are passed to the FUNCTION as its
          third argument (REST).

   To pass keyword arguments to the function, use the usual Scheme
notation: `#:key'.

   As an example, let's consider the invocation of the `fix-subject'
function, defined in the previous subsection:

     guile-process fix-subject <<-EOT
                                     ----------
                                     Kind regards,
                                     Antonius Block
                               EOT

In this example, the additional argument (a string of three lines) is
passed to the function, which will add it to the message of the body.

5.7.3 Support for ROT-13
------------------------

The ROT-13 transformation is a simple form of encryption where the
letters A-M are transposed with the letters L-Z. It is often used in
Usenet postings/mailing lists to prevent people from accidentally
reading a disturbing message.

   GNU Anubis supports ROT-13 via a loadable Guile function. To enable
this support, add the following to your `GUILE' section:

     guile-load-program rot-13.scm

   Then, in your `RULE' section use:

 -- Scheme Function: rot-13 KEYWORD-ARGUMENTS
     The command accepts the following KEYWORD-ARGUMENTS:

    `#:body'
          Encrypt the entire body of the message

    `#:subject'
          Encrypt the `Subject' header.

     For example:

          trigger "rot-13.*body"
           guile-process rot-13 #:body
          done

          trigger "rot-13.*subj"
           guile-process rot-13 #:subject
          done

5.7.4 Remailers Type-I
----------------------

GNU Anubis supports remailers of type I. The support is written
entirely in Scheme. To enable it, you need to specify the following in
the `GUILE' section of your configuration file:

     guile-load-program remailer.scm

   To send the message via a remailer, use the following command in the
`RULE' section:

 -- Scheme Function: remailer-I KEYWORD-ARGUMENTS
     The KEYWORD-ARGUMENTS specify the various parameters for the
     remailer. These are:

    `#:rrt STRING'
          This is the only required keyword argument. It sets the value
          for the "Request Remailing To" line. STRING should be your
          actual recipient's email address.

    `#:post NEWS-GROUP'
          Adds the `Anon-Post-To: NEWS-GROUP' line, and prepares the
          message for sending it to the Usenet via a remailer. Note,
          that this is only possible with remailers that support
          `Anon-Post-To:' header.

    `#:latent TIME'
          Adds the `Latent-Time:' line, that causes a remailer to keep
          your message for specified TIME before forwarding it.

    `#:random'
          Adds random suffix to the latent time.

    `#:header STRING'
          Adds an extra header line to the remailed message.

     Example:

          trigger "remail:(.*)/(.*)"
           guile-process remailer-I \
                       #:rrt antonius_block@helsingor.net \
                       #:post \1 \
                       #:latent \2 \
                       #:header "X-Processed-By: GNU Anubis & Remailer-I"
          done

   Some remailers require the message to be GPG encrypted or signed.
You can do so by placing `gpg-encrypt' or `gpg-sign' statement right
after the invocation of `remailer-I', for example:

     trigger "remail:(.*)/(.*)"
      guile-process remailer-I \
                  #:rrt antonius_block@helsingor.net \
                  #:post \1 \
                  #:latent \2 \
                  #:header "X-Processed-By: GNU Anubis & Remailer-I"
      gpg-sign mykey
     done

   *Note Mail Encryption::, for more information on mail encryption in
GNU Anubis.

5.7.5 Entire Message Filters
----------------------------

There may be cases when you need to use an external filter that
processes entire message (including headers). You cannot use
`external-body-processor', since it feeds only the message body to the
program. To overcome this difficulty, GNU Anubis is shipped with
`entire-msg.scm' module. This module provides Scheme function
`entire-msg-filter', which is to be used in such cases.

 -- Scheme Function: entire-msg-filter PROGRAM [ARGS]
     Feeds entire message to the given program. The output from the
     program replaces message headers and body.

    PROGNAME
          Full pathname of the program to be executed.

    ARGS
          Any additional arguments it may require.

   Suppose you have a program `/usr/libexec/myfilter', that accepts
entire message as its input and produces on standard output a modified
version of this message. The program takes the name of a directory for
temporary files as its argument. The following example illustrates how
to invoke this program:

     BEGIN GUILE
     guile-load-program entire-msg.scm
     END

     BEGIN RULE
     guile-process entire-msg-filter /usr/libexec/myfilter /tmp
     END

   Another function defined in this module is `openssl-filter':

 -- Scheme Function: openssl-filter PROGRAM [ARGS]
     This function is provided for use with `openssl' program.
     `Openssl' binary attempts to rewind its input and fails if the
     latter is a pipe, so `openssl' cannot be used with
     `entire-msg-filter'. Instead, you should use `openssl-filter'. Its
     arguments are:

    PROGRAM
          Path to `openssl' binary.

    ARGS
          Its arguments

     *Note S/MIME::, for an example of use of this function.

6 Invoking GNU Anubis
*********************

The `anubis' executable acts like a daemon, i.e. after a successful
startup it disconnects itself from the controlling terminal(1) and
continues its work in the background. The program reads its initial
settings from the `CONTROL' section of the site-wide configuration file
(*note CONTROL Section::) and from the command line options.

   Command line options have higher priority than configuration file
settings and can be used to temporarily override them.

   The following command line options are understood:

`--altrc FILE'
     Specify alternate system configuration file.

`--bind [HOST:]PORT'
`-b'
     Specify the TCP port on which GNU Anubis listens for connections.
     The default HOST value is `INADDR_ANY', and default PORT number is
     24 (private mail system).

`--check-config[=LEVEL]'
`-c[LEVEL]'
     Run the configuration file syntax checker. Optional LEVEL
     specifies the verbosity level. The following levels are allowed:

    0
          Display only errors. This is the default.

    1
          Print the syntax tree after parsing the file.

    2
          As `1', but also prints the parser traces.

    3
          As `2', but also prints the lexical analyzer traces.

`--debug'
`-D'
     Debug mode.

`--foreground'
`-f'
     Foreground mode.

`--help'
     Print short usage summary and exit.

`--local-mta FILE'
`-l'
     Execute a local SMTP server, which works on standard input and
     output (inetd-type program). This option excludes the
     `--remote-mta' option.

`--mode MODE-NAME'
`-m MODE-NAME'
     Selects Anubis operation mode. Allowed values for MODE-NAME are
     `proxy', `transparent' (the default), `auth' and `mda'. *Note
     Authentication::, for the detailed discussion of Anubis operation
     modes.

`--norc'
     Ignore system configuration file.

`--relax-perm-check'
     Do not check a user config file permissions.

`--remote-mta HOST[:PORT]'
`-r'
     Specify a remote SMTP host name or IP address, which GNU Anubis
     will connect and forward mail to.  The default PORT number is 25.

`--silent'
`-s'
     Work silently.

`--show-config-options'
     Print the list of configuration options used to build GNU Anubis.

`--stdio'
`-i'
     Use the SMTP protocol (OMP/Tunnel) as described in RFC 821 on
     standard input and output.

`--verbose'
`-v'
     Work noisily.

`--version'
     Print version number and copyright.

   Examples:

     $ anubis --remote-mta SMTP-HOST:25

Run GNU Anubis on port number 24 (private mail system). Note that you
must have root privileges to use port number lower than 1024.  Make the
tunnel between your localhost:24 and SMTP-HOST:25.

     $ anubis -f --remote-mta SMTP-HOST:25

Same as above, but run GNU Anubis in a foreground mode.

     $ anubis -f --local-mta /usr/sbin/sendmail -- sendmail -bs

Same as above, but create a tunnel between localhost:24 and a local
program (local MTA). In this example local program is `sendmail' with
`-bs' command line option.  The `-bs' option forces `sendmail' to work
on standard input and output.

     $ anubis --norc --remote-mta SMTP-HOST:25

Do not read the system configuration file, make the tunnel between
localhost:24 and SMTP-HOST:25.

     $ anubis --bind localhost:1111 --remote-mta SMTP-HOST:25

Create the tunnel between localhost:1111 and SMTP-HOST:25.

     $ anubis -i

Use the SMTP protocol (OMP/Tunnel) as described in RFC 821 on standard
input and output.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Unless given the `--foreground' command line option.

7 Quick Start
*************

By default, GNU Anubis binds to port number 24 (private mail system),
so there shouldn't be any conflict with your local MTA (Mail Transport
Agent). You only have to reconfigure your MUA (Mail User Agent) to talk
to GNU Anubis directly on port number 24. All MUAs are normally set up
to talk directly to the MTA, so you must change their settings and
specify GNU Anubis' port number as their target. This makes GNU Anubis
act as an outgoing mail processor between your MUA and the MTA. Read
your MUA's documentation for more information.

   Then you need to choose whether you want to connect GNU Anubis to a
remote or local SMTP host via TCP/IP or a local SMTP program, which
works on standard input and output. In the former case, specify the
following option:

     REMOTE-MTA SMTP-HOST:25

In the latter case (local SMTP program), use this:

     LOCAL-MTA /PATH/TO/YOUR/MTA/MTA-EXECUTABLE -bs

   Please note that the `-bs' command line option is a common way to
run MTAs on standard input and output, but it is not a rule.  Refer to
your MTA's documentation, for instructions on how to get it working on
standard input and output.

   If you would like to run GNU Anubis on port number 25 (which is a
default value for the SMTP) or any other port number, then use the
`bind' keyword. For instance, the following code will bind GNU Anubis
to `localhost:25':

     bind localhost:25

   This can make a conflict between GNU Anubis and your local MTA,
which usually listens on port number 25. To solve this, disable the MTA
and specify the `local-mta' keyword, or run MTA on port number
different than GNU Anubis' port number (e.g. 1111). For example:

     bind localhost:25
     remote-mta localhost:1111

   *Caution:* Make sure that your local machine doesn't accept any
incoming mail (i.e. it is _not_ a POP or IMAP server), otherwise you
cannot disable your MTA or change its port number!

8 Using the TLS/SSL Encryption
******************************

The TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol provides communications
privacy over the Internet. It is described in RFC 2246 document. The
protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that
prevents eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. The primary goal
of the protocol is to provide privacy and data integrity between two
communicating applications. The TLS protocol itself is based on the SSL
3.0 (Secure Socket Layer) protocol specification.

   GNU Anubis supports the TLS/SSL (via the GnuTLS, a Transport Layer
Security Library available from `http://www.gnutls.org/'), but your MTA
must provide the `STARTTLS' command first. This can be checked by:

     $ telnet YOUR-SMTP-HOST 25
       ehlo YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME

The server will response with all its available commands.  If you see
the word `STARTTLS', then you can use the TLS/SSL encryption. If your
MUA doesn't support the TLS/SSL encryption, but your MTA does, then you
should use the `oneway-ssl' keyword in your configuration file. Before
using the TLS/SSL encryption, generate a proper private key and a
certificate. GNU `anubis' provides a scrypt `keygen.sh' which can be
used for this, e.g.:

     $ cd anubis-directory
     $ ./build/keygen.sh

This will create the `anubis.pem' file.  Copy it to the directory of
your choice, e.g. `/usr/share/ssl/certs/'.  Next, edit your
configuration file by adding:

     ssl yes
     ssl-key PATH-TO-THE-PRIVATE-KEY
     ssl-cert PATH-TO-THE-CERTIFICATE

   For example:

     ssl-key /usr/share/ssl/certs/anubis.pem
     ssl-cert /usr/share/ssl/certs/anubis.pem

*Caution:* Each client can specify its own private key and a
certificate by adding the `ssl-key' and `ssl-cert' keywords in its own
user configuration file.

*Note Encryption Settings::, for details.

9 Using S/MIME Signatures
*************************

Anubis version 4.2 does not yet provide built-in support for S/MIME
encryption or signing. To encrypt or sign messages using S/MIME, you
will have to use external programs. Usually such programs require the
whole message as their input, so simply using `external-body-processor'
will not work. GNU Anubis distribution includes a special Guile
program, `entire-msg.scm', designed for use with such programs. For its
detailed description, please refer to *note Entire Message Filters::.
This chapter addresses a special case of using it with `openssl' to
sign outgoing messages.

   To use `openssl' for S/MIME signing, invoke it using
`openssl-filter' function defined in `entire-msg.scm'. Give it at least
`-sign' and `-signer' arguments. Notice, that you should not specify
any input or output files.

   The following example illustrates this approach:

     BEGIN GUILE
     guile-load-program entire-msg.scm
     END

     BEGIN RULE
     guile-process openssl-filter /usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl \
                   smime -sign -signer FILE
     END

10 Using Anubis to Process Incoming Mail
****************************************

Historically Anubis was designed to process outgoing mail. Support for
processing incoming mail was added in version 4.1.

   To process incoming mail, Anubis must be started as "mail delivery
agent" from your MTA configuration file. The invocation line must
contain `--mode=mda' option, that tells Anubis to act in "mail delivery
mode". In this mode, Anubis receives the message from standard input,
processes it using configuration file sections named
`incoming-mail-rule' (*note incoming-mail-rule: Basic Settings.) and
finally calls local mailer to actually deliver the modified message.
The local mailer must be given using `--local-mta' option.

   Let's summarize the special features of mail delivery mode:

  1. The mode is triggered by `--mode=mda' in the command line.  It
     cannot be specified in configuration file.

  2. Anubis uses local mailer to actually deliver messages. The
     invocation line of the local mailer must be given via `--local-mta'
     command line option. The `local-mta' settings (if any) (*note
     Basic Settings::) are ignored.

     The local mailer invocation line can contain meta-variables
     `%sender' and `%recipient', which will be replaced by the actual
     sender and recipient email addresses before starting the mailer.

  3. A special option `--from' may be used in Anubis command line.
     This option sets sender email address (see `%sender' meta variable
     above). It implies `--mode=mda'. If the option is not given, GNU
     Anubis will deduce sender address from UNIX `From ' header or, if
     it is not present, from the value of `From' SMTP header.

  4. In MDA mode, Anubis takes recipient email addresses from the
     command line.

  5. Anubis uses a separate rule section for processing incoming mails.
     The default section name is `INCOMING'. It may be overridden in
     system configuration file using `incoming-mail-rule' (*note
     incoming-mail-rule: Basic Settings.).

   The following discussion explains how to configure Anubis in MDA
mode with different mail transport agents.

   * Sendmail

     If you use `mc' file to generate `sendmail.cf', use
     `LOCAL_MAILER_PATH' and `LOCAL_MAILER_ARGS' as shown in the
     following example:

          define(`LOCAL_MAILER_PATH', `/usr/local/sbin/anubis')
          define(`LOCAL_MAILER_ARGS',
                 `mail --mode=mda -l '/libexec/mail.local -f %sender %recipient')

     If you prefer to directly edit `sendmail.cf', use `M' macro to
     declare Anubis as a local mailer. For example:

          Mlocal, P=/usr/local/sbin/anubis,
                  F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qSPfhn9,
                  S=EnvFromL/HdrFromL, R=EnvToL/HdrToL,
                  T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
                  A=mail --mode=mda -l '/libexec/mail.local -f %sender %recipient' $u

   * Exim

     With `exim', you will need to declare appropriate transport and
     director in `exim.conf':

          # transport
          mail_local_pipe:
            driver = pipe
            command = /usr/local/sbin/anubis --mode=mda \
                       -l '/libexec/mail.local -f %sender %recipient' $local_part
            return_path_add
            delivery_date_add
            envelope_to_add

          # director
          mail_local:
            driver = localuser
            transport = mail_local_pipe


11 Using Mutt with Anubis
*************************

Newer versions of `mutt' (1.5.20) are able to send mail directly via
SMTP channel.  Older ones (1.4.1 and 1.5.3) can only use an external
program to send messages.

   The following sections describe the recommended ways of configuring
`mutt'.

11.1 Configure Mutt SMTP
========================

`Mutt' version 1.5.20 supports SMTP if compiled with the
`--enable-smtp' option. You can verify if it is so by running the
following command:

     mutt -v | fgrep '+USE_SMTP'

   If the output contains `+USE_SMTP', then `mutt' is compiled properly
and you can use further instructions from this section.

`set smtp_url = "URL"'
     Sets URL of the Anubis server. The format of URL is

          smtp://[USER[:PASS]@]host[:PORT]

     where square brackets denote optional parts.  If Anubis is running
     in `auth' mode, USER and PASS become mandatory.  The latter can
     also be set using the following statement.

`set smtp_pass = "PASS"'
     Sets SMTP password.

`set smtp_authenticators="AUTH-LIST"'
     Sets the list of the authentication methods to try when attempting
     to perform SMTP AUTH.  The argument is a colon-delimited list of
     method names.

   For example, if Anubis runs on the server `anubis.domain.org', port
24, your `.muttrc' could contain:

     set smtp_url = "smtp://anubis.domain.org:24"

11.2 Using GNU mailutils as an interface to mutt
================================================

GNU Mailutils is a collection of utilities for handling electronic
mail. It includes lots of programs necessary for dealing with e-mail
messages. One of them is `maidag' -- a general-purpose mail delivery
agent (*note maidag: (mailutils)maidag.).

   The package can be downloaded from `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mailutils'
or any of the mirrors (See `http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html' for a
complete list of these. Please, select the mirror closest too you). The
complete information about the package is available from its home page
at `http://www.gnu.org/software/mailutils/'

   To use `maidag', first download and install GNU mailutils (as usual
the package is shipped with files `README' and `INSTALL' which provide
the necessary guidelines). Then add to your `.muttrc' file the
following line:

     set sendmail="MAIDAG --url smtp://HOSTNAME[:PORT]"

where MAIDAG stands for the full file name of `maidag' utility,
HOSTNAME and optional PORT specify the host name (or IP address) of the
machine running `anubis' and the port it listens on. Notice, that the
default port value for `smtp' is 25, which means that in most cases you
will have to specify it explicitly.

   For example, suppose you run `anubis' on machine
`anubis.example.org' and that it listens on port 24.  Let's also assume
you have installed mailutils in the default location, so that full file
name of the `maidag' utility is `/usr/local/sbin/maidag'. Then, your
`.muttrc' will contain:

     set sendmail="/usr/local/sbin/maidag \
                   --url smtp://anubis.example.org:24"

(the line being split for readability).

11.3 Using msg2smtp.pl as an interface to mutt
==============================================

GNU Anubis is shipped with `msg2smtp.pl' -- a perl script designed as
an interface between it and `mutt'. The script is kindly contributed by
Michael de Beer.

   The script is located in the subdirectory `contrib' of GNU Anubis
distribution. Copy it to any convenient location, e.g.:

     cp anubis-4.2/contrib/msg2smtp.pl /usr/local/libexec

and add the following line to your `.muttrc':

     set sendmail="/usr/local/libexec/msg2smtp.pl -h HOSTNAME -p PORT"

where HOSTNAME and PORT specify the host name (or IP address) of the
machine running `anubis' and the port it listens on, respectively.

   A complete description of `msg2smtp.pl' and a discussion of its
command line switches can be found in file `contrib/msg2smtp.txt'.

Appendix A Pixie & Dixie
************************

   * Introduction

     This document describes a new scheme for client authentication and
     authorization in GNU Anubis 4.x.

   * Task Description

     So far the only authentication method used by Anubis was based on
     the AUTH protocol (RFC 1413)
     (ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1413.txt), and thus required
     client party to use a popular daemon `identd', which listens on
     TCP port 113 for authentication requests. As its primary
     advantage, this method allows to quickly identify whom the server
     had to deal with, i.e. to obtain user name or his UID. Actually,
     the authentication process finishes before the client sends over
     his first byte. Besides, this method allows to process the entire
     SMTP envelope.  It has, however, several drawbacks, first of them
     being the requirement to run `identd' on the client machine, which
     is not always possible (e.g. on mobile devices), and may be
     considered harmful for the system security (due to sending user ID
     over the wire).

   * The Proposed Solution

     Proposed are two operation modes:

       1. "Traditional" or "transparent" (also known as "Pixie" ;-)

       2. "Authentication first" (also known as "Dixie" ;-)

     A short description of each mode follows:

        - `Pixie' mode
             - Server requires the remote party to authenticate itself
               using SMTP AUTH (RFC 2554)
               (ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2554.txt).

             - Early processing of SMTP envelope is possible.

             - Connections between MUA and MTA are tunneled "on the fly"

        - `Dixie' mode In this mode GNU Anubis runs its own user
          database, additionally translating logins (*note login
          translation::). It also is able to keep users' configuration
          files (an additional option and an advantage -- *note anubis
          database::).

     Users are authenticated using ESMTP AUTH protocol. Early processing
     of SMTP envelope is not possible in this mode , instead it becomes
     possible only after the authentication is finished successfully.
     This mode also delays connecting to the MTA, since Anubis first
     has to perform ESMTP AUTH, and only after finishing
     authentication, does it read and process the user's configuration
     file and connects to the selected MTA. Of course, the client is
     not able to begin sending messages until he is authenticated and
     accepted by Anubis.

   * Details

     There is a great difference between the two modes. To begin with,
     `Pixie' mode provides a tunnel (or proxy), in the sense that Anubis
     connects user's MUA to the remote MTA without requiring any
     special actions from the user.

     Let's consider a simple interaction between `Machine-A', which runs
     Anubis 4, and `Machine-B', where MUA is run.

          A: 220 Machine-A (GNU Anubis vX.X [Dixie]) ESMTP time; send your identity!
          B: EHLO Machine-B
          A: 250-Machine-A Hello ID
          250-STARTTLS
          250-AUTH DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 LOGIN
          250-XDATABASE
          250 HELP
          B: STARTTLS
          A: 220 2.0.0 Ready to start TLS
          <TLS>
          B: AUTH <METHOD>
          [method-specific authentication interchange follows]

     Now, the Anubis server has authenticated the client using data from
     Anubis database! I'd like this database to contain, beside the
     user name and password, the name and password of this user on
     Machine-A.

     Confusing? Let's suppose that the database contains following
     record:

           JohnSmith encrypted-pass-1  John

     The user has authenticated himself as `JohnSmith' with password
     `encrypted-pass-1', using ESMTP AUTH, and the given credentials
     matched those from the Anubis database.  Now, Anubis, which has
     been running with super-user privileges, switches to UID of the
     user `John'.

     Such solution will allow for a very flexible database, that would
     ease the administration tasks, since users will be able to update
     their corresponding records (of course, if the system administrator
     grants them such privileges). For instance, ODBC, SQL?

     Let's return to our sample session. After successful authentication
     and switching to the user's privileges, Anubis parses file
     `~/.anubisrc'. Then, based on user's configuration settings, it
     connects to the MTA and from then on operates as SMTP tunnel and
     mail processor :-). It sends the following response to `Machine-B':

          A: 220 OK, Welcome. Continue sending your mail!

   * Further details

     The above description shows that it is impossible to use both
     `Pixie' and `Dixie' simultaneously. It is the responsibility of
     the system administrator to decide which operation mode to use. We
     could probably provide for a smooth switching between the two
     modes, without requiring to restart the daemon... However, it is
     not critical.  Restarting the daemon in order to switch to another
     operation mode is also a feasible solution.

     Now, let me describe for what kind of users each mode is intended.

     The traditional (`Pixie') mode is intended for those users who use
     Anubis on a single machine or within a local network that allows
     to use `identd'. In short, `Pixie' is useful when the use of
     `identd' is possible and safe.

     In contrast, the new mode `Dixie' is intended for more complex
     setups, where a single machine running GNU Anubis serves a number
     of clients connecting from different machines and networks. It is
     supposed that no client machine is running `identd'.  The only
     recommendation for this mode is that each user have a system
     account on the machine running Anubis. But then, even this is not
     required!

     That's a feature I haven't described yet :^) As described above,
     Anubis database must contain second login name in order for Anubis
     to be able to switch to the user's privileges and parse his
     `~/.anubisrc' file.  Now, I supposed that the database is able to
     keep user configuration files as well. So, each database record
     must contain an additional flag informing Anubis whether it should
     read the local file `~/.anubisrc', or read the configuration file
     stored in the database. Sure enough, GNU Anubis still will have to
     switch to the user's privileges, for security reasons, but this
     can be done using usual `user-notprivileged' configuration (*note
     user-notprivileged: Security Settings.).

     Surely you have noticed that in its response to EHLO command Dixie
     returned `250-XDATABASE' capability. Yes, this is exactly that
     command that I'd like to be used for remote management of the
     database records (after having successfully passed ESMTP AUTH).

     Available operations are: `ADD', `MODIFY', `REMOVE', meaning
     addition, modification and removal of a user record, and `UPLOAD',
     providing a way to upload the user's configuration file
     `~/.anubisrc'.

     This solution will free the users from the obligation to have
     `~/.anubisrc' on the server machine, so they, for the first time
     since early Anubis versions, will be able to have their _own_
     configuration files. Current versions((1) require that the user
     configuration file be stored on the server machine before the user
     is able to use the service. This approach requires a certain
     attention from the system administrator. Should the user wish to
     change something in his configuration file, he would have to
     install the modified file on `Machine-A' (that's how it works now,
     and that's how it will continue to work for `Pixie' mode). The new
     `Dixie' mode solves this and frees the user from necessity to
     contact the system administrator of `Machine-A'. The Anubis
     database engine is supposed to check the correctness of the
     uploaded configuration file and inform the client about the
     result. It also should compute MD5 hash of the file and compare it
     to the one sent by the user... What for?

   * A program sending user's configuration file

     Well, we're almost finished. The user will have a small program,
     `config-sender', written in whatever language (C, Java, C#), whose
     main purpose is to send user's configuration file to the database.
     Such a program could even be installed on a mobile device!  Notice
     also, that this program is optional, the user is not required to
     use it. I envision a situation where:

       1. A user logs in to his account on `Machine-B'

       2. His `~/.profile' invokes `config-sender' program. This
          program, in turn, computes MD5 sum of the local `~/.anubisrc'
          file and sends it to Anubis. There it will be compared to the
          sum kept in the Anubis database, and if the two sums differ,
          the `config-sender' will upload the contents of
          `~/.anubisrc'... (2)

       3. The `config-sender' program will, of course, connect to the
          Anubis database using ESMTP (TLS/AUTH) and `XDATABASE'.

     Such a program will be an additional advantage, since no existing
     MUA is, of course, able to use `XDATABASE' command to manage
     Anubis database. Notice however, that GNU Hydrant
     (http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/hydrant) will probably support
     `XDATABASE' in the future...

   * The End.

     Thus, the user will simply use his MUA, no identd, no hassle :)

     Actually, the only requirement for the MUA is that it support ESMTP
     AUTH. Unfortunately, some MUA, even on UNIX-like systems, are still
     not able to use ESMTP AUTH. But in this case, the user can install
     Anubis on his machine and use it to perform authentication ;-)))

     And the last detail: what to do if the remote MTA also requires
     ESMTP AUTH? The answer is quite simple: GNU Anubis is already able
     to handle this (*note esmtp-auth: Basic Settings.).

   * Summary (`Dixie' mode)

        - a little slower than `Pixie', in the sense that the actual
          connection to the MTA is established only after successful
          authentication

        - does not require `identd'!

        - allows the user full control over his configuration settings

        - delays processing of SMTP envelope until after successful
          authentication.

   * PS: A couple of words about storing configuration files in the
     database...

     These can be stored in a special directory as usual files, then
     each database record will have an additional field with the name
     of the configuration file for the given user.

   -- THE END --

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) At the time of writing this document -- Anubis versions up to
3.6.2.

   (2) The scheme implemented currently is a bit different. First, the
`config-sender' program issues an `EXAMINE' command that fetches the
contents of the user configuration file from the server. Then, it
compares it with the local copy kept on the client machine. If the
copies differ, `config-sender' issues `UPLOAD' and thus updates the
configuration on the server.

Appendix B Multi-Part Message Processing
****************************************

  0. PREFACE

     In its current state (as of Anubis version 4.2) Anubis has proven
     to be a useful tool for processing plain text outgoing messages.
     However, its use with MIME messages creates several problems
     despite of a flexible ruleset supported by the program.

     This RFC proposes a new mode of operation that should make
     processing of MIME messages more convenient.

  1. INTRODUCTION

     In general, Anubis processes a message using a set of user-defined
     rules, called "user program", consisting of "conditional
     statements" and "actions". Both of them may operate on message
     body as well as on its headers. This mode of operation suites
     excellently for plain text messages, however it does have its
     drawbacks when processing multi-part messages.

     To begin with, only the first part of multi-part messages is
     processed, the rest of message is usually passed to the MTA
     verbatim. Thus, this part can be processed by the user program
     only if it is in plain text: parts encoded by quoted-printable or,
     worse yet, base-64 encoding cannot be processed this way. The only
     way for the user to process non-plaintext multi-part messages is
     by using some extension procedures (usually external scripts).

     A special configuration setting `read-entire-body' (*note Basic
     Settings::) is provided that forces Anubis to process the entire
     body of a multi-part message (among other effects it means passing
     entire body to the external scripts as well). However, it does not
     help solve the problem, since no attempt is being made to decode
     parts of the message, so the user is left on his own when
     processing such messages.

     The solution proposed by this memo boils down to the following:
     process each part of the multi-part message as a message on its
     own allowing user to define different RULE sections for processing
     different MIME types. The following sections describe the approach
     in more detail.

  2. MULTI-PART MESSAGE PROCESSING

     When processing a multi part message, Anubis first determines its
     MIME type. A user is allowed to define several RULE sections(1)
     that are supposed to handle different MIME types. Anubis keeps a
     `type <-> section' association table (a "dispatcher table") which
     is used to determine the entry point for processing of each
     particular part. If the dispatcher table does not contain an entry
     for the given MIME type, the contents of the part is passed
     verbatim. Otherwise, Anubis decodes the part body and passes it
     for further processing to the RULE section. When invoking this
     particular section, MIME headers act as a message headers and MIME
     body acts as its body. After the code section finishes processing
     of the message part, it is encoded again(2) and then passed to the
     output.

  3. RECURSIVE NATURE

     MIME standards allow multi-part messages to be nested to arbitrary
     depth, therefore the described above process is inherently
     recursive.  This brings following implications:

       1. The dispatcher table must contain several built-in entries
          that will handle recursive descent to the messages of
          determined MIME type.  At least messages having `multipart/*'
          and `message/rfc822' contents must be handled. These entries
          must be configurable, thus giving final user a possibility to
          disable some of them. Preferably there should exist a way of
          specifying new recursive types as well.

       2. A confuguration parameter must be provided that will limit the
          maximum recursion depth for such messages.

  4. MIME DISPATCHER TABLE

     The structure of MIME dispatcher table should allow for flexible
     search of user program entries depending on MIME type of the part
     being processed. It is important also that it allows for a
     "default entry", i.e. an entry that will be used for processing a
     part whose type is not explicitely mentioned in the table. The
     absence of such default entry should be taken as indication that
     the part must be transferred verbatim.

     Thus, each entry of the dispatcher table must contain at least the
     following members.

    `type'
          Specifies regular expressions describing MIME type this entry
          handles.  For the sake of clarity this memo uses shell-style
          regular expressions (see `glob(7)' or `fnmatch(3)'). However,
          Anubis implementation can use any other regular expression
          style it deems appropriate.

    `entry point'
          Specifies an entry point to the code section that handles MIME
          parts of given type. The entry point is either `nil', meaning
          default processing (thus the default entry can be represented
          as `("*" . nil)' _at the end of the table_), or one of
          predefined entry points serving for recursive procession of
          message parts, or, finally, it is a code index of a
          user-defined rule section.

     The dispatcher table can contain several entries matching a given
     MIME type. In this case, the `entry point' of each of them must be
     invoked in turn. For example, consider this dispatcher table:

          <text/plain> => `plaintext'
          <text/x-patch> => `patchfile'
          <text/*> => `anytext'

     When processing a part of type `text/plain' using this dispatcher
     table, first the section named `plaintext' is called, then its
     output is gathered and used as input for the section named
     `anytext'. Such approach allows for building flexible structured
     user programs.

  5. CONFIGURATION ENTITIES

     This memo proposes addition of following configuration entities to
     `CONTROL' section of Anubis configuration file. These entries may
     be used in both system-wide and user-specific configuration files,
     the order of their priority being determined as usual by the
     `rule-priority' statement (*note Security Settings::).

      -- Option: clear-dispatch-table
          This option discards from the dispatcher table all entries
          gathered so far.

      -- Option: dispatch-mime-type SECTION-ID REGEXP-LIST
          This option adds or modifies entries in MIME dispatcher
          table. SECTION-ID specifies the "section identifier", i.e.
          either the name of a user-defined rule section, or one of the
          keywords `none' and `recurse'. In the former case, Anubis
          must make sure the named section is actually defined in the
          configuration file and issue an error message otherwise.

          REGEXP-LIST is whitespace-separated list of regular
          expressions specifying MIME types that are to be handled by
          SECTION-ID.

          The effect of this option is that for each regular expression
          RE from the list REGEXP-LIST, the dispatcher table is
          searched for an entry whose `type' field is exactly the same
          as RE(3). If such an entry is found, its `entry code' field
          is replaced with SECTION-ID. Otherwise, if no matching entry
          was found a new one is constructed:

               (RE . SECTION-ID)

          and appended to the end of the list.

          For example:

               dispatch-mime-type recurse "multipart/*" "message/rfc822"
               dispatch-mime-type Text "text/*"
               dispatch-mime-type none "*"

          This example specifies that messages (or parts) with types
          matching `multipart/*' and `message/rfc822' must be recursed
          into, those of type `text/*' must be processed by
          user-defined section `Text' and the rest of parts must be
          transferred verbatim. The section `Text' must be declared
          somewhere in the configuration file as

               BEGIN Text
               ...
               END

          Notice that the very first `dispatch-mime-type' specifies a
          built-in entry. This memo does not specify whether such a
          built-in entry must be present by default, or it should be
          explicitely declared as in the example above. The explicit
          declaration seems to have advantage of preserving backward
          compatibility with versions 4.0 and earlier of Anubis (*note
          COMPATIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS::).

          Notice also that when encountering the very first
          `dispatch-mime-type' (or `dispatch-mime-type-prepend', see
          below) statement _in the user configuration file_, Anubis must
          remove the default entry (if any) from the existing
          dispatcher table.  Such entry should be added back after
          processing user's `CONTROL' section, unless
          `clear-dispatch-table' has been used.


      -- Option: dispatch-mime-type-prepend SECTION-ID REGEXP-LIST
          Has the same effect as `dispatch-mime-type' except that the
          entries are prepended to the dispatcher table.

      -- Option: recursion-depth NUMBER
          This option limits the maximum recursion depth when processing
          multi-part messages to NUMBER.


  6. TEXT vs BINARY MIME PARTS

     This memo does not determine how exactly is Anubis supposed to
     discern between text and binary messages. The simplest way is by
     using the `Content-Type' header: if it contains `charset=' then it
     describes a text part. Otherwise it describes a binary part.
     Probably some more sophisticated methods should be implemented.

     To avoid dependency on any particular charset, text parts must be
     decoded to UTF-8. Correspondingly, any literals used in Anubis
     configuration files must represent valid UTF-8 strings. However,
     this memo does not specify whether Anubis implementation should
     enforce UTF-8 strings in its configuration files.

     It is possible to specify processing rules for binary MIME parts.
     However, Anubis does not provide any mechanism for binary
     processing, not is it supposed to provide any. This memo maintains
     that the existing `external-body-processor' and `guile-process'
     statements are quite sufficient for processing any binary message
     parts.

  7. SAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE

          BEGIN CONTROL
            dispatch-mime-type recurse "multipart/*" "message/rfc822"
            dispatch-mime-type plaintext "text/plain"
            dispatch-mime-type image "img/*"
          END CONTROL

          SECTION plaintext
            modify body ["now"] "then"
          END

          SECTION image
            external-body-processor resize-message
          END

     This example configuration shows the idea of using
     `external-body-processor' statement for binary part processing.
     The following version of `resize-message' script uses `convert'
     program for reducing image size to 120x120 pixels:

          #! /bin/sh
          TMP=$HOME/tmp/$$
          cat - > $TMP
          convert -size 120x120 $TMP.jpg -resize 120x120 +profile '*' out-$TMP
          rm $TMP
          cat out-$TMP
          rm out-$TMP

  8. COMPATIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS

     In the absense of any `dispatch-mime-type' statements, Anubis
     should behave exactly as version 4.0 did. Specifying

          clear-dispatch-table

     in the user configuration file should produce the same effect. This
     can be useful if system-wide configuration file contained some
     `dispatch-mime-type' statements.

  9. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

     This specification is believed to not introduce any special
     security considerations.

`Content-Type' header and, particularly, its `encoding' part, therefore
it is not necessary that the resulting part is encoded using the same

     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warrany Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

C.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
========================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
